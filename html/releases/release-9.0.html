<h1>Emacspeak-9.0 (BlackLab) Release Notes</h1>

<STRONG>Announcing Emacspeak-9.0 (BlackLab)</STRONG>

<H2>For Immediate Release</H2>



San Jose, Calif.,  (October 24, 1998)<BR>
Emacspeak99: Preparing For The Next Millenium<BR>
--Interactive Accessibility enhances Speech-Enabled Desktop<P>

<H2>What Is It?</H2>

Emacspeak is a fully functional audio desktop that provides
<EM>complete eyes-free</EM> access to all major 32 and 64 bit
operating environments.  By seamlessly blending all aspects of
the Internet such as Web-surfing and electronic messaging
into the audio desktop, Emacspeak enables speech access to
local and remote information with a consistent and
well-integrated user interface.

<H2>Major Enhancements</H2>
<OL>
<LI> Support for nested HTML tables to further enhance Emacspeak's
already efficient navigation and browsing of structured and
multicolumn WWW pages.

<LI>Fluent spoken access to  database applications.

<LI> Speech-enabled support for creating and maintaining XML documents..

<LI> Speech-enabling extensions for the following:
<OL>
    <LI>Speech-enabled SQL: emacspeak-sql.el
    <LI>Network utilities: emacspeak-net-utils.el
    <LI>Enhanced Perl mode: CPerl: emacspeak-cperl.el
    <LI>  Speech-enabled on-the-fly spell checking.
    <LI>  Speech-enabled hyperlink navigation in online help buffers.
    <LI> Locating Emacs source code: emacspeak-find-func.el
</OL>
</OL>

Emacspeak 9.0 speech-enables all  new features introduced in
Emacs 20.3.

See the release notes for additional details.  The Emacspeak source
distribution now includes a structured FAQ list designed to
introduce new and old users to the Emacspeak environment.



<H2>Preparing For The Next Millenium</H2>



Emacspeak is now bundled with <STRONG>all</STRONG> major Linux distributions;
however, users can rest assured that this present version
was not released prematurely to defeat anti-trust concerns.
<P>


At the same time, Emacspeak 99 continues to innovate in the
area of speech interaction and carries forward the
well-established Emacs tradition of introducing user
interface features that commercial user environments
eventually acquire.  On this theme, when recently challenged
by a proponent of a crash-prone but well-marketed windowing
system with the assertion <Q>Emacs is a system from the 70's</Q>,
the creator of Emacspeak expressed surprize at the unusual
candor manifest in the assertion that it would take popular
idiot-proof interfaces until the year 2070 to catch up to
where the Emacspeak audio desktop is today.
<P>


Industry experts welcomed these candid clarifications as a
refreshing breath of Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at
a time when users are reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and
Doubt (FUD) unleashed by complex software systems backed by
meven more convoluted press releases.

<H2>History</H2>

Emacspeak-9.0 --(AKA Emacspeak 99) code named BlackLab--
continues to innovate in the areas of speech interaction and
interactive accessibility.  
Emacspeak-8.0 --(AKA Emacspeak-98++) code named BlackDog--
is a major upgrade to the speech output extension to Emacs.
Emacspeak-95 (code named Illinois) was released on the
Internet in May 1995 as the first complete speech interface
to UNIX workstations.  The subsequent release, Emacspeak-96
(code named Egypt) made available in May 1996 provided
significant enhancements to the interface. Emacspeak-97
(Tennessee) went further in providing a true audio desktop.
Emacspeak-98  integrated  Internetworking
into all aspects of the audio desktop to provide the first
fully interactive speech-enabled WebTop.
