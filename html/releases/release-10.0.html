    --Zero cost of ownership makes priceless software affordable! 
    <h2>What Is It?</h2>
    Emacspeak is a fully functional audio desktop that provides <em>
    complete eyes-free</em> access to all major 32 and 64 bit operating
    environments. By seamlessly blending all aspects of the Internet
    such as Web-surfing and electronic messaging into the audio
    desktop, Emacspeak enables speech access to local and remote
    information with a consistent and well-integrated user interface. 
    <h2>Major Enhancements</h2>

<li>Single click Web search from anywhere on the audio
      desktop.</li>
<LI> Simple DOM-based navigation of WWW pages.</li>

      Emacspeak's already efficient navigation and browsing of
      structured and multicolumn WWW pages.</li>
      <li>Emacspeak 10.0 speech-enables all new features introduced in
      the upcoming Emacs 20.4.</li>
<LI> Includes Edition 2 of the  Emacspeak manual.
    </ul>
    <p>See the NEWS file  for additional details. The Emacspeak
    source distribution now includes a structured FAQ list designed to

    <h2>Opening Doors To A Windows-Free 2000</h2>
    Emacspeak is now bundled with all major Linux distributions.
    Extensive studies have shown that users consider Emacspeak to be
    absolutely priceless. Thanks to this wide-spread user demand, the
    present version is being made available at the same zero cost as
    earlier releases. At the same time, Emacspeak-2000 continues to
    innovate in the area of speech interaction and carries forward the
    well-established Open Source tradition of introducing user
    interface features that eventually show up in commercial user
    environments. On this theme, when recently challenged by a
    proponent of a crash-prone but well-marketed windowing system with
    the assertion "Emacs is a system from the 70's", the creator of
    Emacspeak expressed surprize at the unusual candor manifest in the
    assertion that it would take popular idiot-proof interfaces until
    the year 2070 to catch up to where the Emacspeak audio desktop is
    today. Upon hearing this, the said proponent of the crash-prone
    system turned blue in the face (screen), crashed to the floor and
    refused to get booted (ever again). Industry experts welcomed this
    refreshing breath of Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a time
    when users are reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD)
    unleashed by complex software systems backed by even more
    convoluted press releases. 
    <h2>History</h2>
    Emacspeak-10.0 --(AKA Emacspeak-2000) code named WonderDog-- is the
    latest in a series of award-winning software releases designed to
    make eyes-free computing a productive and pleasurable experience.
    Emacspeak-9.0 --(AKA Emacspeak 99) code named BlackLab-- continued
    to innovate in the areas of speech interaction and interactive
    accessibility. Emacspeak-8.0 --(AKA Emacspeak-98++) code named
    BlackDog-- was a major upgrade to the speech output extension to
    Emacs. 
    <p>Emacspeak-95 (code named Illinois) was released as OpenSource on
    the Internet in May 1995 as the first complete speech interface to
    UNIX workstations. The subsequent release, Emacspeak-96 (code named
    Egypt) made available in May 1996 provided significant enhancements
    to the interface. Emacspeak-97 (Tennessee) went further in
    providing a true audio desktop. Emacspeak-98 integrated
    Internetworking into all aspects of the audio desktop to provide
    the first fully interactive speech-enabled WebTop.</p>
