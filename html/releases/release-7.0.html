32 and 64 bit operating systems.  By seamlessly
blending all aspects of the Internet such as
Web-surfing and electronic messaging into the audio
desktop, Emacspeak enables speech access to local

<H2>History</H2>


Emacspeak-98 (Labrador) is a major upgrade to the
speech output extension to Emacs.  Emacspeak-95 (code
named Illinois) was released on the Internet in May
1995 as the first complete speech interface to UNIX
workstations.  The subsequent release, Emacspeak-96
(code named Egypt) made available in May 1996 provided
significant enhancements to the interface. Emacspeak-97
(Tennessee) went further in providing a true audio
desktop.  Emacspeak-98 goes further by
integratingInternetWorking into all aspects of the
audio desktop to provide the first fully interactive
speech-enabled WebTop.

<H2>What Is New?</H2>

     <DL>
       <DT> Pause And Resume
       <DD> Emacspeak-98 implements an extremely responsive
            pause/resume feature. With this, you can now
            have Emacspeak-98 speak large documents and
            easily pause and resume speech. When speech is
            paused, you can move around the document, read
            words, lines and characters and then resume
            speech where you left off.
            
       <DT> Emacs-20
       <DD> Emacspeak-98 supports the newly released Emacs
       20.2. I have been using emacspeak with emacs 20 for
       about a month now.
              <DT> W3
              <DD> Versions of the Emacs W3 WWW browser
       beyond W3 3.0.86 are difficult to install under a
       default Emacs 19.34 setup. If you plan to use later
       releases of W3 --I use W3 4.0-- you should first
       upgrade to Emacs 20.2
              <DT> CC Mode
              <DD> Newer versions of Barry Warsaw's CC-mode
       (5.xx) are bundled with Emacs 20.2 and
       later. Emacspeak supports this fully, and you get
       support for C++, java etc. with a unified
       interface. Once again, installing cc-mode 5.xx under
       a default emacs-19.34 installation may be difficult
       due to conflicts with older versions of the custom
       libraries.
              <DT> Hiding Blocks
              <DD> Emacspeak-98 has a flexible mechanism to allow you to hide
and expose blocks of text where a <Q>block of text</Q> is a
sequence of lines with a common prefix. This is extremely
useful when reading conversation threads in email, browsing
through source code with many lines commented out etc.
              <DT> Dictionaries
              <DD> You can now define pronunciations that are local to a
buffer. Such definitions are temporary and not written out
to the Emacspeak dictionary.
              <DT> Defining Pronunciations
              <DD> You can now use the contents of  current
       region as  the default when defining dictionary
       entries. Also see command
       emacspeak-pronounce-yank-word.
              <DT> Mobile Desktop
              <DD> In conjunction with screen (available
                   from ftp://ftp.uni-erlangen.de)
                   Emacspeak-98 provides you with a powerful
                   mobile desktop.
                   I routinely run Emacspeak under Screen
                   3.7.4 on my Sun workstation
                   and attach to the running Screen session
                   from my laptop.  Once attached,
                   The Emacspeak session running under
                   Screen on the Sun connects to a speech
                   server (see below) on my laptop.
                   Thus, you get the same effect as setting
                   your X Display to point to  your local
                   machine with the added advantage of being
                   able to use a single session from
                   different locations.
              <DT> Remote Sessions
              <DD> Emacspeak-98 now lets you run a remote speech server to have
speech output from a remote Emacspeak session go to your
local desktop.
Prior versions of Emacspeak did this by launching the speech
       server via an RSH (remote shell) command --this was
       difficult to use when using DHCP (Dynamic IP)--
                    e.g. when you connect via PPP and get a
       different hostname each time.
                   Emacspeak-98 now lets you communicate
       with the remote speech server via a TCP socket --see
       the notes in file remote.txt in the Emacspeak
       distribution.
              <DT> TAR And ZIP Archives
              <DD> Emacspeak now speech-enables the various
       modes for dealing with compressed archives.
              <DT> Enriched Text
              <DD> Emacspeak-98 provides audio formatted
       output for the various modes that use
       Enriched-Text. This means that if you receive
       mime-encoded email with richtext, the messages will
       be automatically audio formatted as they are decoded.
              <DT> Buffer Indices
              <DD> Emacspeak-98 speech-enables package imenu
       to provide context-sensitive buffer indices for easy
       navigation. A W3 addon w3-imenu.el (part of the
       contrib code in Emacs W3) uses this feature to enable
       navigation around W3 buffers --so now you can open a
       WWW page and move through the various sections with a
       single keystroke.
              <DT> Abbrev Mode
              <DD> Abbrev-mode is now speech-enabled so you
       hear the expansion of the abbreviation instead of the
       abbrev you typed in.
              <DT> Outline Mode
              <DD> Emacspeak-98 extends outline mode with
       interactive commands that let you browse through the
       various outline levels. Check out commands
       emacspeak-outline-speak-next-heading  and friends.
              <DT> Lazy Voice Lock
              <DD> Lazy voice-locking speeds up
       voiceification (aural syntax coloring or audio
       formatting based on syntax) by only voiceifying parts
       of the buffer that are currently being displayed.
              <DT> Bookmarks
              <DD> Emacspeak-98 speech-enables Emacs'
       bookmark feature. This allows you to mark positions
       in documents and return to them in later sessions.
              <DT> Remote Auditory Displays
              <DD> Emacspeak-98 can use a remote auditory
       display to produce both speech and auditory icons on
       a local desktop while running on a remote machine.
                   
              <DT> Games
              <DD> You can make up for the time Emacspeak
       saves you with its productive interface by playing
       the following games:
                   
                   <DL>
                     <DT> Tetris
                     <DD> Check this out --tetris itself is
       not bundled with Emacs-- but it is a fun game to play
       with Emacspeak.
                     <DT> Gomoku
                     <DD> I've not managed to beat Emacs at
       this game --the best I have been able to do is to
       draw.
                     <DT> Solitaire
                     <DD> Not the card game-- but the board
       game known as HiQ in North America and as Solitaire
       in Europe.
                   </DL>
            </DL>
