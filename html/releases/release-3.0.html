    <p>* Announcing Emacspeak, a full-fledged speech output
    interface to Emacs. *  Emacspeak is the first full-fledged
    speech output system that will allow someone who cannot see to
    work directly on a UNIX system. (Until now, the only option
    available to visually impaired users has been to use a talking
    PC as a terminal.) Emacspeak is built on top of Emacs. Once you
    start emacs with emacspeak loaded, you get spoken feedback for
    everything you do. Your mileage will vary depending on how well
    you can use Emacs.There is nothing that you cannot do inside
    Emacs:-)</p>

    <p>I currently use Emacspeak at work on my DECALPHA workstation
    running Digital UNIX. I also use Emacspeak as the only speech
    output system on my laptop running Linux. Emacspeak currently
    supports the new Dectalk Express speech synthesizer, as well as
    older versions of the Dectalk e.g. the MultiVoice. On the
    DECALPHA, you can use it with the software Dectalk. (If you
    have a DECALPHA and also have software Dectalk installed at
    your site, please get in touch with me and I'll give you some
    additional code that emacspeak needs to work with the software
    Dectalk.)</p>

    <p>You need GNU FSF Emacs 19 (version 19.23 or later) and TCLX
    7.3B (Extended TCL) to run Emacspeak. See the Emacspeak
    distribution for additional details. Available from the
    following sites: FTP: <a
    href="ftp://crl.dec.com/pub/digital/emacspeak/emacspeak.tar.gz">
    ftp://crl.dec.com/pub/digital/emacspeak/emacspeak.tar.gz</a>

    http://www.research.digital.com/CRL/personal/raman/emacspeak/emacspeak.tar.gz</a></p>

    <p>Emacspeak comes with full source level documentation. There
    is an online info manual as well, but this is still
    incomplete.</p>

    <p>EMACS SUBSYSTEMS</p>

    <p>Emacspeak currently has extensions for many popular Emacs
    subsystems including:</p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o W3: A full-fledged W3 browser
    [available by FTP]. Emacspeak implements a<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;voice-lock mode analogous
    to Emacs' font-locking that allows it to speak <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WWW hotlinks using
    different ~voice personalities~. <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o GNUS: The Emacs news reader.
    Emacspeak provides a fluent extension to <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gnus that allows you to
    listen to Usenet news without taking your <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fingers off the four arrow
    keys. <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o VM: The Emacs VM mail reader.
    Emacspeak works with VM to present email <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;messages using different
    voices; Parts of a message that are cited from <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a previous message are
    ~voicified~to produce effective aural <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;presentations. <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Eterm: The Emacs 19 terminal
    emulator. (This will be part of Emacs <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19.29). You can obtain a
    beta copy of eterm [via anonymous FTP]. I have <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;used Emacspeak and Eterm to
    successfully login to work from my laptop <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and interface with running
    applications on my office workstation <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(including running Emacs
    sessions!). <br />
    <br />
    <br />
     

    <p>Emacspeak also works well with Emacs addons like AUCTEX for
    editing TeX documents, the Emacs Calculator (CALC --a symbolic
    algebra system) etc.</p>

    <p>Emacspeak works fluently with all Emacs addons; writing an
    extension makes its use even more pleasurable. If you would
    like to write an Emacspeak addon for your favorite package
    please get in touch with me so we do not end up duplicating
    work.</p>

    <p>SUPPORT FOR EMACSPEAK</p>

    <p>Emacspeak comes as is, please see the accompanying
    [Copyright] notice. See the [README]file for details about this
