    <h1>Emacspeak-11.0 (Aster) Release Notes</h1>
    <strong>Announcing Emacspeak-11.0 (Aster)</strong> 
    <h2>For Immediate Release</h2>
    Mountain View, Calif., (November 29, 1999)<br />
    Emacspeak-2000: Opening Doors To A Windows-Free 2000.<br />
    --Zero cost of ownership makes priceless software affordable! 
    <h2>What Is It?</h2>
    Emacspeak is a fully functional audio desktop that provides <em>
    complete eyes-free</em> access to all major 32 and 64 bit operating
    environments. By seamlessly blending all aspects of the Internet
    such as Web-surfing and electronic messaging into the audio
    desktop, Emacspeak enables speech access to local and remote
    information with a consistent and well-integrated user
interface.
With support for the freely
downloadable IBM ViaVoice Outloud speech synthesis engine,
Emacspeak now turns Linux into the <STRONG>first zero-cost Internet
access</STRONG> solution for blind and visually impaired users.



<h2>Code Name Note</h2>

After 10 years of loyal service, Aster Labrador retired
from active duty as a guide-dog on November 28, 1999.  She
has agreed to stay on as Emacspeak's press contact for the
immediate future.  This release is code named Aster in
honour of her unflagging service over these last 10 years.


<h2>Emacspeak At The Bazaar</h2>


The speech-enabling approach as implemented in Emacspeak and
its relevance to speech-enabling the Linux desktop will be
presented at <a href="http://www.thebazaar.org">
The Bazaar --The Technology Of Cooperation</a>
at the Jacob Javits Center, New York, December 15, 1999.


    <h2>Major Enhancements</h2>
    <ol>
<li> Support for IBM ViaVoice Outloud (beta) for Linux.
<li> Further enhancements to single-click web-search.
<li> Enhanced auditory icons using midi synthesis.
<li> Single click access to desktop audio utilities
including
<ol>
   <li> Mixer (aumix) support for setting mixer values
    <li>CD player support via cdplay
   <li> MP3 support via mpg123
</ol>
<li> Speech-enabled RPM browser.
<li> Speech-enabled gnuplot support.
<li>--and a lot more than will fit in this margin.
</ol>
    <p>See the NEWS file  for additional details. The Emacspeak
    source distribution now includes a structured FAQ list designed to
    introduce new and old users to the Emacspeak environment.</p>
    <h2>Opening Doors To A Windows-Free 2000</h2>
    Emacspeak is now voluntarily bundled with all major Linux distributions.
    Extensive studies have shown that users consider Emacspeak to be
    absolutely priceless. Thanks to this wide-spread user demand, the
    present version is being made available at the same zero cost as
    earlier releases. At the same time, Emacspeak-2000 continues to
    innovate in the area of speech interaction and carries forward the
    well-established Open Source tradition of introducing user
    interface features that eventually show up in commercial user
    environments. On this theme, when recently challenged by a
    proponent of a crash-prone but well-marketed windowing system with
    the assertion "Emacs is a system from the 70's", the creator of
    Emacspeak expressed surprize at the unusual candor manifest in the
    assertion that it would take popular idiot-proof interfaces until
    the year 2070 to catch up to where the Emacspeak audio desktop is
    today. Upon hearing this, the said proponent of the crash-prone
    system turned blue in the face (screen), crashed to the floor and
    refused to get booted (ever again). Industry experts welcomed this
    refreshing breath of Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a time
    when users are reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD)
    unleashed by complex software systems backed by even more
    convoluted press releases.


<h2>Independent Test Results</h2>


Independent test results have proven that unlike some modern
software, Emacspeak can be easily uninstalled without
adversely affecting the continued performance of the
computer.  These same tests also revealed that once
uninstalled, the user stopped functioning altogether.

Speaking with Aster Labrador this morning, the creator
of Emacspeak pointed out that these results once again
emphasize the user-centric design of Emacspeak; "It is
the user --and not the computer-- that stops
functioning when Emacspeak is uninstalled!".

<STRONG>Note from Aster</STRONG>: (UnDoctored Videos Inc. is currently looking for
volunteers to star in a video demonstrating such complete
user failure).


    <h2>History</h2>
 
Emacspeak-11.0 --code named Aster-- goes the final step in
making Linux a <STRONG>zero-cost Internet access</STRONG> solution for blind
and visually impaired users.
    Emacspeak-10.0 --(AKA Emacspeak-2000) code named WonderDog-- was the
    last in a series of award-winning software releases designed to
    make eyes-free computing a productive and pleasurable experience.
    Emacspeak-9.0 --(AKA Emacspeak 99) code named BlackLab-- continued
    to innovate in the areas of speech interaction and interactive
    accessibility. Emacspeak-8.0 --(AKA Emacspeak-98++) code named
    BlackDog-- was a major upgrade to the speech output extension to
    Emacs. 
    <p>Emacspeak-95 (code named Illinois) was released as OpenSource on
    the Internet in May 1995 as the first complete speech interface to
    UNIX workstations. The subsequent release, Emacspeak-96 (code named
    Egypt) made available in May 1996 provided significant enhancements
    to the interface. Emacspeak-97 (Tennessee) went further in
    providing a true audio desktop. Emacspeak-98 integrated
    Internetworking into all aspects of the audio desktop to provide
    the first fully interactive speech-enabled WebTop.</p>
