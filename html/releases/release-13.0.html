<P>

Emacspeak Inc <A HREF="http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net">(NASDOG: ESPK)</A> announces  the immediate
world-wide availability of Emacspeak 13.0 --a powerful audio
desktop for leveraging today's evolving semantic WWW.
</p>


<h2>What Is It?</h2>
<p>
Emacspeak is a fully functional audio desktop that provides <em>
complete eyes-free</em> access to all major 32 and 64 bit operating
environments. By seamlessly blending all aspects of the Internet
such as Web-surfing and electronic messaging into the audio
desktop, Emacspeak enables speech access to local and remote
information with a consistent and well-integrated user
interface.  A rich suite of task-oriented 
tools provides efficient speech-enabled access to the
evolving semantic WWW.  With support for the freely
downloadable IBM ViaVoice TTS (Outloud)  speech synthesis engine,
Emacspeak now turns Linux into the <STRONG>first zero-cost
Internet access</STRONG> solution for blind and visually
impaired users.
</p>
<h2>Major Enhancements</h2>

 <li>Graphical Desktop Environments
<ol   class="alpha">
    <li>   Sawfish: Interface Sawfish window manager to TTS servers.</li>
    <li>  Sample configuration for   speech-enabling Sawfish.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>   Sound Themes: Configurable themes for auditory icons.</li>
<li>  Streaming Media: Navigate media streams using FreeAmp and TRPlayer.</li>
<li>  Music:  Single click access to MP3 playlists.</li>

source distribution now includes a structured FAQ list designed to
introduce new and old users to the Emacspeak
environment.</p>

<h2>Opening Doors To A Windows-Free Millennium</h2>
<p>
Emacspeak is now voluntarily bundled with all major Linux
distributions.
The integrity of the Emacspeak codebase is
ensured by the reliable and secure Linux platform used to develop
the software.  
Extensive studies have shown that
thanks to these features, users consider Emacspeak to be
absolutely priceless. Thanks to this wide-spread user demand, the
present version is being made available at the same zero cost as
earlier releases. At the same time, Emacspeak-2001 continues to
innovate in the area of speech interaction and carries forward the
well-established Open Source tradition of introducing user
interface features that eventually show up in commercial user
environments. On this theme, when recently challenged by a
proponent of a crash-prone but well-marketed windowing system with
the assertion <q>Emacs is a system from the 70's</q>, the creator of
Emacspeak expressed surprize at the unusual candor manifest in the
assertion that it would take popular idiot-proof interfaces until
the year 2070 to catch up to where the Emacspeak audio desktop is
today. Upon hearing this, the said proponent of the crash-prone
system turned blue in the face (screen), crashed to the floor and
refused to get booted (ever again).
</P>
<p>
Industry experts welcomed this
refreshing breath of Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a time
when users are reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD)
unleashed by complex software systems backed by even more
convoluted press releases.
</p>


<h2>Independent Test Results</h2>

<p>
Independent test results have proven that unlike some modern
software, Emacspeak can be easily uninstalled without
adversely affecting the continued performance of the
computer.  These same tests also revealed that once
uninstalled, the user stopped functioning altogether.
</p>
<p>
Speaking with Aster Labrador, the creator
of Emacspeak once pointed out that these results 
re-emphasize the user-centric design of Emacspeak; <q>It is
the user --and not the computer-- that stops
functioning when Emacspeak is uninstalled!</q>.
</p>
<P>
<STRONG>Note from Aster and Bubbles</STRONG>: (UnDoctored Videos Inc. is currently looking for
volunteers to star in a video demonstrating such complete
user failure).


<h2>History</h2>
<p>
Emacspeak-13.0 --codenamed YellowLab-- is the newest in a series
of award-winning audio desktop releases from Emacspeak Inc.
Emacspeak-12.0 --code named GoldenDog--
first leveraged the evolving semantic WWW to provide task-oriented
speech access to electronic information on the Internet.
Emacspeak-11.0 --code named Aster-- went the   final step in
making Linux a <STRONG>zero-cost Internet access</STRONG>
solution for blind and visually impaired users.
Emacspeak-10.0 --(AKA Emacspeak-2000) code named WonderDog--
was the last in a series of award-winning software releases
designed to make eyes-free computing a productive and
pleasurable experience.  Emacspeak-9.0 --(AKA Emacspeak 99)
code named BlackLab-- continued to innovate in the areas of
speech interaction and interactive
accessibility. Emacspeak-8.0 --(AKA Emacspeak-98++) code
named BlackDog-- was a major upgrade to the speech output
extension to Emacs.
</p>

<p>Emacspeak-95 (code named Illinois)
was released as OpenSource on the Internet in May 1995 as
the first complete speech interface to UNIX
workstations. The subsequent release, Emacspeak-96 (code
named Egypt) made available in May 1996 provided significant
enhancements to the interface. Emacspeak-97 (Tennessee) went
further in providing a true audio desktop. Emacspeak-98
integrated Internetworking into all aspects of the audio
desktop to provide the first fully interactive
speech-enabled WebTop.</p>

ftp://ftp.cs.cornell.edu/pub/raman/emacspeak/</a>.
</p>

<p>
Note that in my  experience the the sourceforge site is more
reliable than the Cornell site due to the operating system
each site has chosen to run.
