<H2>Independent Test Results</H2>




Independent test results have proven that unlike some modern
software, Emacspeak-98 can be easily uninstalled without
adversely affecting the continued performance of the
computer.  These same tests also revealed that once
uninstalled, the user <EM>stopped</EM> functioning altogether.

<P>


Industry experts welcomed these results as a refreshing
breath of Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a time
when users are reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and
Doubt (FUD) unleashed by complex software systems
backed by even more convoluted press releases.

<P>


Speaking with Aster Labrador this morning, the creator
of Emacspeak pointed out that these results once again
emphasize the user-centric design of Emacspeak;

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It is the user --and not the computer-- that
stops functioning when Emacspeak is uninstalled!

<H2>History</H2>


Emacspeak-8.0 --(AKA Emacspeak-98++) code named BlackDog--
is a major upgrade to the speech output extension to Emacs.
Emacspeak-95 (code named Illinois) was released on the
Internet in May 1995 as the first complete speech interface
to UNIX workstations.  The subsequent release, Emacspeak-96
(code named Egypt) made available in May 1996 provided
significant enhancements to the interface. Emacspeak-97
(Tennessee) went further in providing a true audio desktop.
Emacspeak-98  integrated  Internetworking
into all aspects of the audio desktop to provide the first
fully interactive speech-enabled WebTop.  This release
re-establishes user-centric computing as demonstrated in
the test results described earlier in this announcement.
