San Jose, Calif., (May 13, 2010)
Emacspeak: Bringing tweet Access For   social beings
&ndash;Zero cost of upgrades/downgrades makes priceless software affordable!
</p>
<p>
Emacspeak Inc (NASDOG: ESPK) --<a href="http://emacspeak.sf.net">http://emacspeak.sf.net</a>--
announces the immediate world-wide availability of Emacspeak
32.0 (LuckyDog) &ndash;a powerful audio desktop for leveraging today's evolving
data, social and service-oriented  Web cloud.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1.2">



<p>
With several prominent tweeters expanding coverage, NASDOG: ESPK
has now been consistently trading over the net at levels close
to that once attained by DogCom high-fliers &mdash; and as of
October 2009 is trading at levels close to that achieved by
once better known stocks in the tech sector.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1.3">



<p>
Emacspeak is a fully functional audio desktop that provides
complete eyes-free access to all major 32 and 64 bit operating
environments. By seamlessly blending live access to all aspects
of the Internet such as Web-surfing, blogging, social computing
and electronic messaging into the audio desktop, Emacspeak
enables speech access to local and remote information with a
consistent and well-integrated user interface. A rich suite of
task-oriented tools provides efficient speech-enabled access to
the evolving service-oriented Web cloud.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1.5">



<p>
Never a toy system, Emacspeak is voluntarily bundled with all
major Linux distributions. Though designed to be modular,
distributors have freely chosen to bundle the fully integrated
system without any undue pressure &mdash; a documented success for
the integrated innovation embodied by Emacspeak. As the system
evolves, both upgrades and downgrades continue to be available at
the same zero-cost to all users. The integrity of the Emacspeak
codebase is ensured by the reliable and secure Linux platform
used to develop and distribute the software.
</p>
<p>
Extensive studies have shown that thanks to these features, users
consider Emacspeak to be absolutely priceless. Thanks to this
wide-spread user demand, the present version remains   priceless
as ever &mdash; it is being made available at the same zero-cost as
previous releases.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, Emacspeak continues to innovate in the area of
eyes-free social interaction and carries forward the
well-established Open Source tradition of introducing user
interface features that eventually show up in luser environments.
</p>
<p>
On this theme, when once challenged by a proponent of a
crash-prone but well-marketed mousetrap with the assertion
"Emacs is a system from the 70's", the creator of Emacspeak
evinced surprise at the unusual candor manifest in the assertion
that it would take popular idiot-proven interfaces until the year
2070 to catch up to where the Emacspeak audio desktop is
today. Industry experts welcomed this refreshing breath of
Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a time when users are
reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD) unleashed by
complex software systems backed by even more convoluted press
releases.

<h3 id="sec-1.6"><span class="section-number-3">1.6</span> Independent Test Results: </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1.6">



<p>
Independent test results have proven that unlike some modern (and
not so modern) software, Emacspeak can be safely uninstalled without
adversely affecting the continued performance of the computer. These
same tests also revealed that once uninstalled, the user stopped
functioning altogether. Speaking with Aster Labrador, the creator of
Emacspeak once pointed out that these results re-emphasize the
user-centric design of Emacspeak; "It is the user &ndash;and not the
computer&ndash; that stops functioning when Emacspeak is uninstalled!".
