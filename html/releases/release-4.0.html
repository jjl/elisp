<H2>Additional Comments</H2>

This release of Emacspeak includes many enhancements as well as fixes made
over a period of seven months. Major improvements include:
<UL>
<LI>  Emacspeak is better about stopping immediately when in
     comint modes e.g. shell-mode.
<LI> Fluent interaction when using ANGE-FTP --an auditory progress monitor cuts on
the amount of speech you hear.
<LI> Fixes to the DTK driver to handle split caps and capitalization modes better.
<LI> <STRONG>Many</STRONG> more interactive commands, execute C-h C-e to get an
overview.
</UL>
<H2>Acknowledgements</H2>

I would like to thank Adobe Systems for providing me with an excellent
computing environment at home --this has enabled me to continue working on
emacspeak in my spare time.
