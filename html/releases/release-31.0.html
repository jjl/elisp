With several prominent tweeters expanding coverage, NASDOG: ESPK
has now been consistently trading over the net at levels close
to that once attained by DogCom high-fliers &mdash; and as of
October 2009 is trading at levels close to that achieved by
once better known stocks in the tech sector.

</p>
<p>
Emacspeak is a fully functional audio desktop that provides
complete eyes-free access to all major 32 and 64 bit operating
environments. By seamlessly blending live access to all aspects
of the Internet such as Web-surfing, blogging, social computing
and electronic messaging into the audio desktop, Emacspeak
enables speech access to local and remote information with a
consistent and well-integrated user interface. A rich suite of
task-oriented tools provides efficient speech-enabled access to
the evolving service-oriented Web cloud.

</p>
<p>
Never a toy system, Emacspeak is voluntarily bundled with all
major Linux distributions. Though designed to be modular,
distributors have freely chosen to bundle the fully integrated
system without any undue pressure &mdash; a documented success for
the integrated innovation embodied by Emacspeak. As the system
evolves, both upgrades and downgrades continue to be available at
the same zero-cost to all users. The integrity of the Emacspeak
codebase is ensured by the reliable and secure Linux platform
used to develop and distribute the software.
</p>
<p>
Extensive studies have shown that thanks to these features, users
consider Emacspeak to be absolutely priceless. Thanks to this
wide-spread user demand, the present version remains   priceless
as ever &mdash; it is being made available at the same zero-cost as
previous releases.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, Emacspeak continues to innovate in the area of
eyes-free social interaction and carries forward the
well-established Open Source tradition of introducing user
interface features that eventually show up in luser environments.
</p>
<p>
On this theme, when once challenged by a proponent of a
crash-prone but well-marketed mousetrap with the assertion
"Emacs is a system from the 70's", the creator of Emacspeak
evinced surprise at the unusual candor manifest in the assertion
that it would take popular idiot-proven interfaces until the year
2070 to catch up to where the Emacspeak audio desktop is
today. Industry experts welcomed this refreshing breath of
Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a time when users are
reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD) unleashed by
complex software systems backed by even more convoluted press
releases.

<h3 id="sec-2.5">2.5 Independent Test Results:</h3>
<div id="text-2.5">

<p>
<hr/>
</p>
<p>
Independent test results have proven that unlike some modern (and
not so modern) software, Emacspeak can be safely uninstalled without
adversely affecting the continued performance of the computer. These
same tests also revealed that once uninstalled, the user stopped
functioning altogether. Speaking with Aster Labrador, the creator of
Emacspeak once pointed out that these results re-emphasize the
user-centric design of Emacspeak; "It is the user &ndash;and not the
computer&ndash; that stops functioning when Emacspeak is uninstalled!".

<p>to the Emacspeak desktop. Emacspeak 30.0 AKA SocialDog brings the
Social Web to the audio desktop &mdash; you cant but be social if you
speak! Emacspeak 29.0 &mdash; AKAAbleDog &mdash; is a testament to the
resilliance and innovation embodied by Open Source software ---
it would not exist without the thriving Emacs community that
continues to ensure that Emacs remains one of the premier user
environments despite perhaps also being one of the
oldest. Emacspeak 28.0 &mdash; AKA PuppyDog &mdash; exemplifies the rapid
pace of development evinced by Open Source software. Emacspeak
27.0 &mdash; AKA FastDog &mdash; is the latest in a sequence of upgrades
that make previous releases obsolete and downgrades
unnecessary. Emacspeak 26 &mdash; AKA LeadDog &mdash; continues the
tradition of introducing innovative access solutions that are
unfettered by the constraints inherent in traditional adaptive
technologies. Emacspeak 25 &ndash; AKA ActiveDog &ndash; re-activates open,
unfettered access to online information. Emacspeak-Alive &ndash; AKA
LiveDog &ndash; enlivens open, unfettered information access with a
series of live updates that once again demonstrate the power and
agility of open source software development. Emacspeak 23.0 --
AKA Retriever &mdash; went the extra mile in fetching full
access. Emacspeak 22.0 &ndash; AKA GuideDog &ndash; helps users navigate
the Web more effectively than ever before. Emacspeak 21.0 &ndash; AKA
PlayDog &ndash; continued the Emacspeak tradition of relying on
enhanced productivity to liberate users. Emacspeak-20.0 &ndash; AKA
LeapDog &ndash; continues the long established GNU/Emacs tradition of
integrated innovation to create a pleasurable computing
environment for eyes-free interaction. emacspeak-19.0 &ndash;AKA
WorkDog&ndash; is designed to enhance user productivity at work and
leisure. Emacspeak-18.0 &ndash;code named GoodDog&ndash; continued the
Emacspeak tradition of enhancing user productivity and thereby
reducing total cost of ownership. Emacspeak-17.0 &ndash;code named
HappyDog&ndash; enhances user productivity by exploiting today's
evolving WWW standards. Emacspeak-16.0 &ndash;code named CleverDog--
the follow-up to SmartDog&ndash; continued the tradition of working
better, faster, smarter. Emacspeak-15.0 &ndash;code named
SmartDog&ndash;followed up on TopDog as the next in a continuing a
series of award-winning audio desktop releases from Emacspeak
Inc. Emacspeak-14.0 &ndash;code named TopDog&ndash;was the first release of
this millennium. Emacspeak-13.0 &ndash;codenamed YellowLab&ndash; was the
closing release of the 20th. century. Emacspeak-12.0 &ndash;code named
GoldenDog&ndash; began leveraging the evolving semantic WWW to provide
task-oriented speech access to Webformation. Emacspeak-11.0
&ndash;code named Aster&ndash; went the final step in making Linux a
zero-cost Internet access solution for blind and visually
impaired users. Emacspeak-10.0 &ndash;(AKA Emacspeak-2000) code named
WonderDog&ndash; continued the tradition of award-winning software
releases designed to make eyes-free computing a productive and
pleasurable experience. Emacspeak-9.0 &ndash;(AKA Emacspeak 99) code
named BlackLab&ndash; continued to innovate in the areas of speech
interaction and interactive accessibility. Emacspeak-8.0 &ndash;(AKA
Emacspeak-98++) code named BlackDog&ndash; was a major upgrade to the
speech output extension to Emacs.
</p>
<p>
Emacspeak-95 (code named Illinois) was released as OpenSource on
the Internet in May 1995 as the first complete speech interface
to UNIX workstations. The subsequent release, Emacspeak-96 (code
named Egypt) made available in May 1996 provided significant
enhancements to the interface. Emacspeak-97 (Tennessee) went
further in providing a true audio desktop. Emacspeak-98
integrated Internetworking into all aspects of the audio desktop
to provide the first fully interactive speech-enabled WebTop.
