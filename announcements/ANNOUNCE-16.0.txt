               Emacspeak-16.0 (CleverDog) Unleashed!
               ----------------------------------

For Immediate Release:

San Jose, Calif., (May 4, 2002)
    Emacspeak-2002: Empowering Experienced Users
    --Zero cost of ownership makes priceless software affordable!

Emacspeak Inc (NASDOG: ESPK) --http://emacspeak.sf.net--
announces the immediate world-wide availability of Emacspeak
16.0 --a powerful audio desktop for leveraging today's
evolving semantic WWW.

Investors Note:
---------------

With several prominent analysts recently initiating coverage, NASDOG:
ESPK is now trading over the net at levels close to that recently
attained by last year's DogCom high-fliers.

What Is It?
-----------

Emacspeak is a fully functional audio desktop that provides
complete eyes-free access to all major 32 and 64 bit operating
environments. By seamlessly blending all aspects of the Internet
such as Web-surfing and electronic messaging into the audio
desktop, Emacspeak enables speech access to local and remote
information with a consistent and well-integrated user
interface. A rich suite of task-oriented tools provides efficient
speech-enabled access to the evolving semantic WWW. 

Major Enhancements:
-------------------



 1) Implements a prototype DAISY Digital Talking Book reader.
2) Speech enables W3M --an alternate WWW browser.
3) Speech enabled support for  IMCom,  a Python Jabber client.
4) XML Shell using XMLLint for browsing XML.
5) Speech-enables analog.el -- powerful log analyzer.
6) Simple speech-enabler for periodic table of elements.
7) Pronunciation dictionaries can be editted via an Emacs/Custom interface.
8) Wizards  for viewing XLS and PPT files.
9) New WebSearch tools.
10) New URL templates.

See the NEWS file for additional details. 

Establishing Freedom:
---------------------

All of Emacspeak is now voluntarily bundled with all major Linux
distributions.  Though designed to be modular, distributors have
freely chosen to bundle the entire system without any undue
pressure.  The integrity of the Emacspeak codebase is ensured by the
reliable and secure Linux platform used to develop the software.

Extensive studies have shown that thanks to these features, users
consider Emacspeak to be absolutely priceless. Thanks to this
wide-spread user demand, the present version is being made available
at the same zero-cost as earlier releases.

At the same time, Emacspeak-2002 continues to innovate in the
area of speech interaction and carries forward the
well-established Open Source tradition of introducing user
interface features that eventually show up in commercial user
environments. On this theme, when once challenged by a proponent
of a crash-prone but well-marketed windowing system with the
assertion "Emacs is a system from the 70's", the creator of
Emacspeak expressed surprise at the unusual candor manifest in
the assertion that it would take popular idiot-proven interfaces
until the year 2070 to catch up to where the Emacspeak audio
desktop is today.  Industry experts welcomed this refreshing
breath of Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a time when
users are reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD)
unleashed by complex software systems backed by even more
convoluted press releases.

Independent Test Results:
-------------------------

Independent test results have proven that unlike some modern software,
Emacspeak can be safely uninstalled without adversely affecting the
continued performance of the computer. These same tests also revealed
that once uninstalled, the user stopped functioning altogether.
Speaking with Aster Labrador, the creator of Emacspeak once pointed
out that these results re-emphasize the user-centric design of
Emacspeak; "It is the user --and not the computer-- that stops
functioning when Emacspeak is uninstalled!".

Note from Aster and Bubbles:
----------------------------

UnDoctored Videos Inc. is currently looking for volunteers to
star in a video demonstrating such complete user failure.

History:
--------

Emacspeak-16.0 --code named CleverDog-- is the follow-up to SmartDog
--and continues the tradition of working better, faster, smarter.
Emacspeak-15.0 --code named SmartDog--followed up on  TopDog as the
next in a continuing a series of award-winning audio desktop releases
from Emacspeak Inc.  Emacspeak-14.0 --code named TopDog--was the first
release of this millennium.  Emacspeak-13.0 --codenamed YellowLab--
was the closing release of the 20th. century.  Emacspeak-12.0 --code
named GoldenDog-- began leveraging the evolving semantic WWW to
provide task-oriented speech access to Webformation. Emacspeak-11.0
--code named Aster-- went the final step in making Linux a zero-cost
Internet access solution for blind and visually impaired
users. Emacspeak-10.0 --(AKA Emacspeak-2000) code named WonderDog--
continued the tradition of award-winning software releases designed to
make eyes-free computing a productive and pleasurable
experience. Emacspeak-9.0 --(AKA Emacspeak 99) code named BlackLab--
continued to innovate in the areas of speech interaction and
interactive accessibility. Emacspeak-8.0 --(AKA Emacspeak-98++) code
named BlackDog-- was a major upgrade to the speech output extension to
Emacs.

Emacspeak-95 (code named Illinois) was released as OpenSource on
the Internet in May 1995 as the first complete speech interface
to UNIX workstations. The subsequent release, Emacspeak-96 (code
named Egypt) made available in May 1996 provided significant
enhancements to the interface. Emacspeak-97 (Tennessee) went
further in providing a true audio desktop. Emacspeak-98
integrated Internetworking into all aspects of the audio desktop
to provide the first fully interactive speech-enabled WebTop.

About Emacspeak:
----------------

Based at Cornell (NY) http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/raman
--home to Auditory User Interfaces (AUI) on the WWW-- and
SourceForge --http://emacspeak.sf.net-- Emacspeak is mirrored
world-wide by an international network of software archives
and bundled voluntarily with all major Linux distributions. On
Monday, April 12, 1999, Emacspeak became part of the
Smithsonian's Permanent Research Collection on Information
Technology at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American
History.

The Emacspeak mailing list is archived at Vassar --the home of the
Emacspeak mailing list-- thanks to Greg Priest-Dorman, and provides a
valuable knowledge base for new users.

Press/Analyst Contact: Hubbell Labrador

BubbleDog acknowledges her monopoly on the future direction
 the the Emacspeak Audio Desktop, and promises to exercise
 her power responsibly (as before) going forward.

About This Release:
------------------

According to Hubbell Labrador, this release does not contain
the much-vaunted SmartTag feature --despite the codename.
Emacspeak Inc. promises to introduce SmartDogs soon based on
customer demand.

Windows-Free (WF) is a favorite battle-cry of The League Against
