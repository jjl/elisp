*               Emacspeak-37.0 (SolidDog) Unleashed!
               

**  For Immediate Release:

San Jose, Calif., (December 21, 2012)
    Emacspeak:  Redefining Accessibility In The Era Of Cloud Computing
    --Zero cost of upgrades/downgrades makes priceless software affordable!

Emacspeak Inc (NASDOG: ESPK) --http://emacspeak.sf.net--
announces the immediate world-wide availability of Emacspeak
37.0 (SolidDog) --a powerful audio desktop for leveraging today's evolving
data, social and service-oriented  Web cloud.

** Investors Note:


With several prominent tweeters expanding coverage of
_#emacspeak_, NASDOG: ESPK has now been consistently trading over
the net at levels close to that once attained by DogCom
high-fliers‚Äîand as of October 2009 is trading at levels close to
that achieved by once better known stocks in the tech sector.

** What Is It?


Emacspeak is a fully functional audio desktop that provides
complete eyes-free access to all major 32 and 64 bit operating
environments. By seamlessly blending live access to all aspects
of the Internet such as Web-surfing, blogging, social computing
and electronic messaging into the audio desktop, Emacspeak
enables speech access to local and remote information with a
consistent and well-integrated user interface. A rich suite of
task-oriented tools provides efficient speech-enabled access to
the evolving service-oriented social Web cloud.

** Major Enhancements:
    
  - Full EPub support: üìë
  - Websearch enhancements and wizards: üêö
  - Updated support  git interaction via magit: ‚Ñ£
  - Speech-enables module Kite for debugging Web Apps in Chrome ‚õ≥
  - TTS  enhancements: üôä
  - Updated url templates for task-oriented web actions: ‚ôÖ
  - SSH port forwarding support for TTS serversüîâ
  - Tested against Emacs 23 on stock Ubuntu Lucid..Precise.
  - Emacs 24 Support  Updated support for the forthcoming Emacs
       24 release.

Plus many more changes too numerous to fit in this margin ... ‚àû

** Establishing Liberty, Equality And Freedom:


  Never a toy system, Emacspeak is voluntarily bundled with all
major Linux distributions. Though designed to be modular,
distributors have freely chosen to bundle the fully integrated
system without any undue pressure‚Äîa documented success for
the integrated innovation embodied by Emacspeak. As the system
evolves, both upgrades and downgrades continue to be available at
the same zero-cost to all users. The integrity of the Emacspeak
codebase is ensured by the reliable and secure Linux platform
used to develop and distribute the software.

Extensive studies have shown that thanks to these features, users
consider Emacspeak to be absolutely priceless. Thanks to this
wide-spread user demand, the present version remains   priceless
as ever‚Äîit is being made available at the same zero-cost as
previous releases.

At the same time, Emacspeak continues to innovate in the area of
eyes-free social interaction and carries forward the
well-established Open Source tradition of introducing user
interface features that eventually show up in luser environments.

On this theme, when once challenged by a proponent of a
crash-prone but well-marketed mousetrap with the assertion
"Emacs is a system from the 70's", the creator of Emacspeak
evinced surprise at the unusual candor manifest in the assertion
that it would take popular idiot-proven interfaces until the year
2070 to catch up to where the Emacspeak audio desktop is
today. Industry experts welcomed this refreshing breath of
Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a time when users are
reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD) unleashed by
complex software systems backed by even more convoluted press
releases.

** Independent Test Results:


Independent test results have proven that unlike some modern (and
not so modern) software, Emacspeak can be safely uninstalled without
adversely affecting the continued performance of the computer. These
same tests also revealed that once uninstalled, the user stopped
functioning altogether. Speaking with Aster Labrador, the creator of
Emacspeak once pointed out that these results re-emphasize the
user-centric design of Emacspeak; "It is the user --and not the
computer-- that stops functioning when Emacspeak is uninstalled!".

*** Note from Aster,Bubbles and Tilden:


UnDoctored Videos Inc. is looking for volunteers to star in a
video demonstrating such complete user failure.

About Emacspeak:
----------------

Originally based at Cornell (NY)
http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/raman --home to Auditory User
Interfaces (AUI) on the WWW-- Emacspeak is now maintained on
GoogleCode --http://code.google.com/p/emacspeak ‚Äîand
Sourceforge ‚Äîhttp://emacspeak.sf.net. The system is mirrored
world-wide by an international network of software archives and
bundled voluntarily with all major Linux distributions. On
Monday, April 12, 1999, Emacspeak became part of the
Smithsonian's Permanent Research Collection on Information
Technology at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American
History.

The Emacspeak mailing list is archived at Vassar --the home of the
Emacspeak mailing list-- thanks to Greg Priest-Dorman, and provides a
valuable knowledge base for new users.

Going forward, Tilden acknowledges his exclusive monopoly on
setting the direction of the Emacspeak Audio Desktop, and
promises to exercise this freedom to innovate and her resulting
power responsibly (as before) in the interest of all dogs.
