Brief Introduction and Tips:

 The best way to use the emacspeak queue feature in the shell is
 to play MUD game (I found discworld the best game to play with
 emacspeak-queue ) The MUD game will output message in real time and
 they can be spoken by emacspeak-queue functionality promptly. If you
 feel the queued message is much and overwhelming, you simply flush
 the queue by emacspeak-queue-clear-queue function. I use TinyFugue
 version 4.0 stable 1 as my MUD game client, it works perfectly in the
 shell. You can install it from software center if you are using
 ubuntu.

And the emacspeak-queue feature also make the on-line chatting easier.
I modified the output of the emacs-jabber so that all the incoming
message can be spoken automatically. You do not need to move your cursor around.

1.the advice  comint-output-filter will be overwritten with a new one defined in the emacspeak-queue.el,
 which enables queue style speaking in the shell in emacs 

2.If you try using shell by typing M-x shell in emacspeak after the emacspeak-queue.el is loaded.
 You will find the queue style speaking. That is, all the outputs of the shell is pushed into a queue, which will be spoken one by one. 
 You will be allowed to pause or resume  the speech by binding the function  emacspeak-queue-pause-or-resume to a convenient key
 and clear the queue by  emacspeak-queue-clear-queue function.
 Usually what I do is bind the emacspeak-queue-clear-queue to ESC key
 I combined a lot of functions to ESC key to be a function called generic-quit
 (e.g.          (emacspeak-queue-clear-queue)     (w3m-form-input-select-exit)     (View-quit)     (keyboard-quit)  ,etc.)
 If I want to flush the current queue, I simply press ESC key.

 And I bind the emacspeak-queue-pause-or-resume to <pause> key , which
 allows me to pause and resume with only one key conveniently. I also
 modified emacs-jabber output so that the incoming message can be
 queued/buffered and spoken automatically. When you receive a message, go to
 that chatting buffer and execute emacspeak-queue-pause-or-resume. You
 will hear the buffered message.

3. If you want to disable or enable the emacspeak-queue feature in the
 commint/shell, you can simply execute function:
 emacspeak-queue-comint-output-toggle. If you disable it, you will get
 the default comint output as before. you may want to bind this
 function to some key for your convenience.

4. sometimes the emacspeak-queue feature doesn't work properly (mostly
happens in the shell mode). All you need to do is to execute C-e C-s
or M-x tts-restart so that the speech server can be reset and
emacspeak-queue feature can be fixed.


Installation:

first add several lines of code and re-compile the emacspeak/servers/linux-outloud/atcleci.cpp file as follows :

   //add a function declaration
   int          pcm_avail(ClientData, Tcl_Interp *, int, Tcl_Obj * CONST[]);

   //add a function definition
   int pcm_avail(ClientData eciHandle, Tcl_Interp * interp,
   int objc, Tcl_Obj * CONST objv[])
   {    
   return (int)(snd_pcm_avail(AHandle)) ;
   }

   // add one line of code in the Atcleci_Init function 
   Tcl_CreateObjCommand(interp, "pcm_avail", pcm_avail, (ClientData) eciHandle, NULL);

and then re-compile the atcleci.cpp to make the changes effective 

second , add a function into emacspeak/servers/outloud file 

//add a function 

   proc pa {} {
   pcm_avail
   }

third, test the outloud server as follows:
$./outloud
type command pa
If everything works well, you will get a bad return code, for example:
Bad return code (2097151): 
this is fine, because I do not know how to make it a good return code. however,
 it still carries information, i.e. the number in the parentheses indicates whether the emacspeak speech server is speaking through alsa pcm
I'm not very sure the return code is platform dependent or not . I only tested it in Ubuntu 11.04 and 11.10 in different computers.
 and one of the lenovo G450 returns (-32) when the alsa pcm is idle. I will list the code for idle status as follows: 
 (-32)    :idle
(2097151) :idle 
(2097152) :idle 
(otherwise): the pcm is busy speaking

Fourth, load the emacspeak-queue.el 

(load-file "~/the-path-to-your-emacspeak-queue.el")

Fifth, go to the shell by M-x shell . By default, the emacspeak-queue
feature is enabled. You may want to press C-e C-s to reset tts if the
output is not working properly. And if you want to disable
emacspeak-queue feature , execute emacspeak-queue-comint-output-toggle
command.

That is all.

Enjoy,
