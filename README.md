elisp
=====

What is it?
-----------

It's my emacs configuration. Well, some of it.

How is it structured?
---------------------

 - The *vendor* dir is where libraries I use belong in their upstream versions. Most will be git submodules.
 - The *site* dir is where libraries I've written reside. There may not be any for a while
 - The *cust* dir is where my configurations go. Feel free to base yours on it or ignore it.

Fundamentals
------------

I treat emacs as a text editor. I rarely use other features of it and I don't anticipate reading my mail in it, IRCing from it or browsing the web in it. I have other tools for that. If you want that, jrockway has his elisp repository (which I couldn't get to grips with properly) on github and you should check that out.

Warning
-------

This is for personal use. I don't guarantee anything will be usable by other people, but I'll try to.
