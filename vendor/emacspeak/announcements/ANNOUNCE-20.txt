               ----------------------------------

For Immediate Release:

San Jose, Calif., (May 1, 2004)
    Emacspeak-2004: Empowering Experienced Users
    --Zero cost of ownership makes priceless software affordable!

Emacspeak Inc (NASDOG: ESPK) --http://emacspeak.sf.net--
announces the immediate world-wide availability of Emacspeak 20.0
--a powerful audio desktop for leveraging today's evolving
service-oriented semantic WWW.

Investors Note:
---------------

With several prominent analysts initiating coverage, NASDOG: ESPK
is now trading over the net at levels close to that once
attained by  DogCom high-fliers.

What Is It?
-----------

Emacspeak is a fully functional audio desktop that provides
complete eyes-free access to all major 32 and 64 bit operating
environments. By seamlessly blending all aspects of the Internet
such as Web-surfing and electronic messaging into the audio
desktop, Emacspeak enables speech access to local and remote
information with a consistent and well-integrated user interface.
A rich suite of task-oriented tools provides efficient
speech-enabled access to the evolving semantic WWW.

Major Enhancements:
-------------------

0)      Adds outline and bookmark support for Daisy Digital Books.
1)      Speech-enables package ido.el.
2)      Speech-enables package iswitchb.
3)      Speech-enables new visual GDB interface (Emacs 21.3.50
CVS).
4)      Speech-enables package re-builder.el.
5)      Enhances XSLT support within Emacs/W3.
6)      New productivity wizards.
7)      New URL templates for productive Web access.
8)      Updated WebSearch tools.
9)      Updated JDE support.
10)     Updated ECB support. 


See the NEWS file for additional details. 

Establishing Freedom:
---------------------

  Never a toy system, Emacspeak is now voluntarily bundled with
all major Linux distributions. Though designed to be modular,
distributors have freely chosen to bundle the fully integrated
system without any undue pressure --- a documented success for
the integrated innovation embodied by the system. The integrity
of the Emacspeak codebase is ensured by the reliable and secure
Linux platform used to develop the software.

Extensive studies have shown that thanks to these features, users
consider Emacspeak to be absolutely priceless. Thanks to this
wide-spread user demand, the present version is being made
available at the same zero-cost as earlier releases.

At the same time, Emacspeak-2003 continues to innovate in the
area of speech and multimodal interaction and carries forward the
well-established Open Source tradition of introducing user
interface features that eventually show up in luser environments.
On this theme, when once challenged by a proponent of a
crash-prone but well-marketed windowing system with the assertion
"Emacs is a system from the 70's", the creator of Emacspeak
evinced surprise at the unusual candor manifest in the
assertion that it would take popular idiot-proven interfaces
until the year 2070 to catch up to where the Emacspeak audio
desktop is today. Industry experts welcomed this refreshing
breath of Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a time when
users are reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD)
unleashed by complex software systems backed by even more
convoluted press releases.

Independent Test Results:
-------------------------

Independent test results have proven that unlike some modern (and
not so modern) software, Emacspeak can be safely uninstalled
without adversely affecting the continued performance of the
computer. These same tests also revealed that once uninstalled,
the user stopped functioning altogether. Speaking with Aster
Labrador, the creator of Emacspeak once pointed out that these
results re-emphasize the user-centric design of Emacspeak; "It is
the user --and not the computer-- that stops functioning when
Emacspeak is uninstalled!".

Note from Aster and Bubbles:
----------------------------

UnDoctored Videos Inc. is currently looking for volunteers to
star in a video demonstrating such complete user failure.

Obtaining Emacspeak:
--------------------

Emacspeak can be downloaded from sourceforge --see
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/emacspeak/ You can visit
Emacspeak on the WWW at http://emacspeak.sf.net.  You can
subscribe to the emacspeak mailing list emacspeak@cs.vassar.edu
by sending mail to the list request address
emacspeak-request@cs.vassar.edu.  The latest development snapshot
of Emacspeak is available via anonymous CVS from sourceforge.

History:
--------

 Emacspeak-20.0 -- AKA LeapDog -- continues the long established
GNU/Emacs tradition of integrated innovation to create a
pleasurable computing environment for eyes-free interaction.
emacspeak-19.0 --AKA WorkDog-- is designed to enhance user
productivity at work and leisure.  Emacspeak-18.0 --code named
GoodDog-- continued the Emacspeak tradition of enhancing user
productivity and thereby reducing total cost of ownership.
Emacspeak-17.0 --code named HappyDog-- enhances user productivity
by exploiting today's evolving WWW standards. Emacspeak-16.0
--code named CleverDog-- the follow-up to SmartDog-- continued
the tradition of working better, faster, smarter. Emacspeak-15.0
--code named SmartDog--followed up on TopDog as the next in a
continuing a series of award-winning audio desktop releases from
Emacspeak Inc.  Emacspeak-14.0 --code named TopDog--was the first
release of this millennium. Emacspeak-13.0 --codenamed
YellowLab-- was the closing release of the
20th. century. Emacspeak-12.0 --code named GoldenDog-- began
leveraging the evolving semantic WWW to provide task-oriented
speech access to Webformation. Emacspeak-11.0 --code named
Aster-- went the final step in making Linux a zero-cost Internet
access solution for blind and visually impaired
users. Emacspeak-10.0 --(AKA Emacspeak-2000) code named
WonderDog-- continued the tradition of award-winning software
releases designed to make eyes-free computing a productive and
pleasurable experience. Emacspeak-9.0 --(AKA Emacspeak 99) code
named BlackLab-- continued to innovate in the areas of speech
interaction and interactive accessibility. Emacspeak-8.0 --(AKA
Emacspeak-98++) code named BlackDog-- was a major upgrade to the
speech output extension to Emacs.

Emacspeak-95 (code named Illinois) was released as OpenSource on
the Internet in May 1995 as the first complete speech interface
to UNIX workstations. The subsequent release, Emacspeak-96 (code
named Egypt) made available in May 1996 provided significant
enhancements to the interface. Emacspeak-97 (Tennessee) went
further in providing a true audio desktop. Emacspeak-98
integrated Internetworking into all aspects of the audio desktop
to provide the first fully interactive speech-enabled WebTop.

About Emacspeak:
----------------

Originally based at Cornell (NY)
http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/raman --home to Auditory User
Interfaces (AUI) on the WWW-- Emacspeak is now maintained on
SourceForge --http://emacspeak.sf.net-- and  is mirrored
world-wide by an international network of software archives and
bundled voluntarily with all major Linux distributions. On
Monday, April 12, 1999, Emacspeak became part of the
Smithsonian's Permanent Research Collection on Information
Technology at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American
History.

The Emacspeak mailing list is archived at Vassar --the home of the
Emacspeak mailing list-- thanks to Greg Priest-Dorman, and provides a
valuable knowledge base for new users.

Going forward, BubbleDog acknowledges her monopoly on setting the
direction of the Emacspeak Audio Desktop, and promises to exercise
this freedom to innovate and her resulting power responsibly (as
before) in the interest of all dogs.
