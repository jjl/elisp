                       Emacspeak-98 Reestablishes User-Centric Computing
                       -------------------------------------------------------------------------

For Immediate Release:

San Jose, Calif.,  (December 25, 1997)   
Emacspeak-98 reestablishes user-centric computing.

Independent test results have proven that unlike some
modern software, Emacspeak-98 can be easily uninstalled
without adversely affecting the continued performance
of the computer.  These same tests also revealed that
once Emacspeak was uninstalled, the user stopped
functioning altogether.

Industry experts welcomed these results as a refreshing
breath of Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a time
when users are reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and
Doubt (FUD) unleashed by complex software systems
backed by even more convoluted press releases.

Speaking with Aster Labrador this morning, the creator
of Emacspeak pointed out that these results once again
emphasize the user-centric design of Emacspeak; "It is
the user --and not the computer-- that stops
functioning when Emacspeak is uninstalled!".
