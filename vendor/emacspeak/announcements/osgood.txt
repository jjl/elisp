I apologize for the canned nature of this response, but I've
been inundated with calls since this program aired.
Thanks in advance for your understanding--

Here are some details about the speech software described in
the interview on the CBS Osgood File 
Thursday, February 11, 1999.

The software described --Emacspeak-- is freely available on
the Internet --see the WWW site
http://cs.cornell.edu/home/raman/emacspeak for details.

Things to note:
---------------

1) The software works on all flavors of UNIX --including
   Linux--
but not on MS Windows or the Mac.

2) The software is distributed as open source and is
   available free of cost on the Internet --it is developped
   in my spare time.

Please do not email or phone requests for having copies
mailed out etc.
