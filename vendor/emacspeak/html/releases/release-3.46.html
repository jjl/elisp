<h1>Emacspeak 3.46 Release Notes</h1>



There are significant improvements to emacspeak since the last release,
summarized below.

1) Improved support for the eterm package (eterm allows you to open a terminal
inside emacs)
2) Improved vm support.
3) Introduced support for the info  reader.
4) Introduced support for auctex.
5) Improved gnus support 
(Note: introducing support means that these packages are more fun to use with
emacspeak)
6) Introduced a module for producing auditory icons.
If you have a sound card, emacspeak will give you auditory feedback for
significant events using "sound cues" in addition to the spoken feedback.
