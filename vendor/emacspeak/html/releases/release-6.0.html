<STRONG>
ANNOUNCING EMACSPEAK-97++ (INTERNET PLUSPACK)
</STRONG>
<P>




This is to announce Emacspeak-97++ (The Internet PlusPack).  Based on unique
Interactive Accessibility technology, Emacspeak-97++ provides a powerful
Internet ready audio desktop that completely integrates Internet technologies
including Web surfing and messaging into all aspects of the electronic
desktop.
<P>


This is a  major upgrade to my speech output extension to Emacs.
Emacspeak 95 (code named Illinois)
was released on the Internet in May 1995 as the first complete
speech interface to UNIX workstations.
The subsequent  release, Emacspeak-96 (code named Egypt) made
available in May 1996  provided significant enhancements to the
interface. Emacspeak-97 (Tennessee) goes further in providing a true audio
desktop.

<H2>Release Notes</H2>

Emacspeak-97 in conjunction with W3 3.0.XX provides a full implementation of
speech style sheets as per the ACCS specification.
<A HREF="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/pub/elisp/w3">W3</A>
has been evolving rapidly. Emacspeak users are urged to upgrade to the newest
version of W3 as support for the older  versions will gradually fall off.
As of W3 3.0, the speech support is integrated into W3; bug reports that are
specific to W3 and Emacspeak should be mailed to the author of W3
<A HREF="mailto:wmperry@cs.indiana.edu">William Perry</A>
and copied to me.
<P>

Emacspeak-97++ supports
<A HREF="ftp://cs.nyu.edu/pub/local/fox/dismal">DISMAL</A> -- a powerful
spread sheet application.

<P>

As usual Emacspeak-97++ comes with full source-level documentation; please use
the online help that is available.
