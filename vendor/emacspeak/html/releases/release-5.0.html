<STRONG>Announcing Emacspeak-97</STRONG>


This is to announce Emacspeak-97  (code named Tennessee)
--a major upgrade to my speech output extension to Emacs.

was released on the Internet in May 1995 as the first complete
speech interface to UNIX workstations.

<H2>Release Notes</H2>

Emacspeak 97 in conjunction with W3 3.0.XX provides a full implementation of
speech style sheets as per the CSS1.0 specification.
<A HREF="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/pub/elisp/w3">W3</A>
has been evolving rapidly. Emacspeak users are urged to upgrade to the newest
version of W3 as support for the older  versions will gradually fall off.
As of W3 3.0, the speech support is integrated into W3; bug reports that are
specific to W3 and Emacspeak should be mailed to the author of W3
<A HREF="mailto:wmperry@cs.indiana.edu">William Perry</A>
and copied to me.
<P>

Emacspeak 97 supports
<A HREF="ftp://cs.nyu.edu/pub/local/fox/dismal">DISMAL</A> -- a powerful
spread sheet application.

<P>

As usual Emacspeak 97 comes with full source-level documentation; please use
the online help that is available.
