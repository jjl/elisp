    <P>

      Emacspeak Inc <A HREF="http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net">(NASDOG: ESPK)</A> announces  the immediate
      world-wide availability of Emacspeak 18.0 --a powerful audio
      desktop for leveraging today's evolving semantic WWW.
    </p>
      <h2>Investors Note</h2>
      <p>
        With several prominent analysts  initiating coverage,
        NASDOG: ESPK is now trading over the net at levels close to that
        attained recently by last year's DogCom high-fliers.
      </p>


      <h2>What Is It?</h2>
      <p>
        Emacspeak is a fully functional audio desktop that provides <em>
          complete eyes-free</em> access to all major 32 and 64 bit operating
        environments. By seamlessly blending all aspects of the Internet
        such as Web-surfing and electronic messaging into the audio
        desktop, Emacspeak enables speech access to local and remote
        information with a consistent and well-integrated user
        interface.  A rich suite of task-oriented 
        tools provides efficient speech-enabled access to the
        evolving semantic WWW.  
    </p>
      <h2>Major Enhancements</h2>
 
<ol>
<li>  Enhanced Emacs 21 support.</li>
<li> emacspeak-wizards.el --Additional productivity wizards.</li>
<li> New voice lock engine.</li>
<li> VC viewer.</li>
<li> RSS wizards.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>See the NEWS file  for additional details. </p>

      <h2>Establishing Freedom</h2>
      <p>Never a toy environment,
All of Emacspeak is now voluntarily bundled with all major Linux
distributions. Though designed to be modular, distributors have freely
chosen to bundle the entire system without any undue pressure. The
integrity of the Emacspeak codebase is ensured by the reliable and
secure Linux platform used to develop the software. Extensive studies
have shown that thanks to these features, users consider Emacspeak to
be absolutely priceless. Thanks to this wide-spread user demand, the
present version is being made available at the same zero cost as
earlier releases. At the same time, Emacspeak continues to innovate in
the area of speech interaction and carries forward the
well-established Open Source tradition of introducing user interface
features that eventually show up in luser environments. On
this theme, when recently challenged by a proponent of a crash-prone
but well-marketed windowing system with the assertion <q>Emacs is a
system from the 70's</q>, the creator of Emacspeak expressed surprize
at the unusual candor manifest in the assertion that it would take
popular idiot-proven interfaces until the year 2070 to catch up to
where the Emacspeak audio desktop is today. Industry experts welcomed
this refreshing breath of Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a
time when users are reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD)
unleashed by complex software systems backed by even more convoluted
press releases.
    </p>


    <h2>Independent Test Results</h2>

    <p>
      Independent test results have proven that unlike some modern
      software, Emacspeak can be easily uninstalled without
      adversely affecting the continued performance of the
      computer.  These same tests also revealed that once
      uninstalled, the user stopped functioning altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speaking with Aster Labrador, the creator
      of Emacspeak once pointed out that these results 
      re-emphasize the user-centric design of Emacspeak; <q>It is
        the user --and not the computer-- that stops
        functioning when Emacspeak is uninstalled!</q>
    </p>
    <P>
      <STRONG>Note from Aster and Bubbles</STRONG>: (UnDoctored Videos Inc. is currently looking for
      volunteers to star in a video demonstrating such complete
      user failure).

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
        Emacspeak-18.0 --code named GoodDog-- continues the the Emacspeak
tradition of enhancing user productivity and thereby  reduces  total cost of
ownership.  
Emacspeak-17.0 --code named HappyDog--
enhances user productivity by
exploiting today's evolving WWW standards. 
Emacspeak-16.0 --code named CleverDog-- was the follow-up to SmartDog
--and continued the tradition of working better, faster, smarter.
      Emacspeak-15.0 --code named SmartDog--followed up on  TopDog
as  the next in a continuing a series of award-winning audio
desktop releases from Emacspeak Inc.  Emacspeak-14.0 --code named
TopDog--was the first release of this millennium.  
Emacspeak-13.0 --codenamed
      YellowLab-- was the closing release of the 20th. century.
      Emacspeak-12.0 --code named GoldenDog--
      first leveraged the evolving semantic WWW to provide task-oriented
      speech access to electronic information on the Internet.
      Emacspeak-11.0 --code named Aster-- went the   final step in
      making Linux a <STRONG>zero-cost Internet access</STRONG>
      solution for blind and visually impaired users.
      Emacspeak-10.0 --(AKA Emacspeak-2000) code named WonderDog--
      was the last in a series of award-winning software releases
      designed to make eyes-free computing a productive and
      pleasurable experience.  Emacspeak-9.0 --(AKA Emacspeak 99)
      code named BlackLab-- continued to innovate in the areas of
      speech interaction and interactive
      accessibility. Emacspeak-8.0 --(AKA Emacspeak-98++) code
      named BlackDog-- was a major upgrade to the speech output
      extension to Emacs.
    </p>

    <p>Emacspeak-95 (code named Illinois)
      was released as OpenSource on the Internet in May 1995 as
      the first complete speech interface to UNIX
      workstations. The subsequent release, Emacspeak-96 (code
      named Egypt) made available in May 1996 provided significant
      enhancements to the interface. Emacspeak-97 (Tennessee) went
      further in providing a true audio desktop. Emacspeak-98
      integrated Internetworking into all aspects of the audio
      desktop to provide the first fully interactive
      speech-enabled WebTop.</p>
