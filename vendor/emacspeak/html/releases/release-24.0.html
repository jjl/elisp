    </p>
    <h2>Investors Note</h2>
    <p>
      With several prominent analysts  initiating coverage,
      NASDOG: ESPK continues to trade  over the net at levels close to that

    <h2>Establishing Liberty, Equality And Freedom</h2
    <p>Never a toy environment, All of Emacspeak is now
    voluntarily bundled with all major Linux
    distributions. Though designed to be modular, distributors
    have freely chosen to bundle the entire system without any
    undue pressure. The integrity of the Emacspeak codebase is
    ensured by the reliable and secure Linux platform used to
    develop the software. Extensive studies have shown that
    thanks to these features, users consider Emacspeak to be
    absolutely priceless. Thanks to this wide-spread user demand,
    the present version is being made available at the same zero
    cost as earlier releases. At the same time, Emacspeak
    continues to innovate in the area of speech interaction and
    carries forward the well-established Open Source tradition of
    introducing user interface features that eventually show up
    in luser environments. On this theme, when challenged by a
    proponent of a crash-prone but well-marketed windowing system
    with the assertion <q>Emacs is a system from the 70's</q>,
    the creator of Emacspeak expressed surprize at the unusual
    candor manifest in the assertion that it would take popular
    idiot-proven interfaces until the year 2070 to catch up to
    where the Emacspeak audio desktop is today. Industry experts
    welcomed this refreshing breath of Courage Certainty and
    Clarity (CCC) at a time when users are reeling from the Fear
    Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD) unleashed by complex software
    systems backed by even more convoluted press releases.
    </p>
    
    
    <h2>Independent Test Results</h2>
    
    <p>
      Independent test results have proven that unlike some
      modern (and not so modern) software, Emacspeak can be
      easily uninstalled without adversely affecting the
      continued performance of the computer.  These same tests
      also revealed that once uninstalled, the user stopped
      functioning altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speaking with Aster Labrador, the creator
      of Emacspeak once pointed out that these results 
      re-emphasize the user-centric design of Emacspeak; <q>It is
      the user --and not the computer-- that stops
      functioning when Emacspeak is uninstalled!</q>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note from Aster and Bubbles</strong>: (UnDoctored Videos Inc. is currently looking for
      volunteers to star in a video demonstrating such complete
      user failure).

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
Emacspeak-Alive -- AKA LiveDog -- enlivens open, unfettered
information access with a series of live updates that once again
demonstrate the power and agility of open source software
development.  Emacspeak 23.0 -- AKA Retriever --- went the extra
mile in fetching full access.  Emacspeak-22.0 -- AKA GuideDog --
helps users navigate the Web more effectively than ever before.
Emacspeak 21.0 -- AKA PlayDog -- continues the Emacspeak
tradition of relying on enhanced productivity to liberate users.
Emacspeak-20.0 -- AKA LeapDog -- continues the long established
GNU/Emacs tradition of integrated innovation to create a
pleasurable computing environment for eyes-free interaction.

      Emacspeak-19 --AKA WorkDog-- was designed to enhance user
      productivity at work and leisure.  Emacspeak-18.0 --code named
      GoodDog-- continues  the Emacspeak tradition of enhancing user
      productivity and thereby reduces total cost of ownership.
      Emacspeak-17.0 --code named HappyDog-- enhances user productivity
      by exploiting today's evolving WWW standards.  Emacspeak-16.0
      --code named CleverDog-- was the follow-up to SmartDog --and
      continued the tradition of working better, faster, smarter.
      Emacspeak-15.0 --code named SmartDog--followed up on TopDog as
      the next in a continuing a series of award-winning audio desktop
      releases from Emacspeak Inc.  Emacspeak-14.0 --code named
      TopDog--was the first release of this millennium.  Emacspeak-13.0
      --codenamed YellowLab-- was the closing release of the
      20th. century.  Emacspeak-12.0 --code named GoldenDog-- first
      leveraged the evolving semantic WWW to provide task-oriented
      speech access to electronic information on the Internet.
      Emacspeak-11.0 --code named Aster-- went the final step in making
      Linux a <strong>zero-cost Internet access</strong> solution for
      blind and visually impaired users.  Emacspeak-10.0 --(AKA
      Emacspeak-2000) code named WonderDog-- was the last in a series
      of award-winning software releases designed to make eyes-free
      computing a productive and pleasurable experience.  Emacspeak-9.0
      --(AKA Emacspeak 99) code named BlackLab-- continued to innovate
      in the areas of speech interaction and interactive
      accessibility. Emacspeak-8.0 --(AKA Emacspeak-98++) code named
      BlackDog-- was a major upgrade to the speech output extension to
      Emacs.
    </p>
    
    <p>Emacspeak-95 (code named Illinois)
    was released as OpenSource on the Internet in May 1995 as
    the first complete speech interface to UNIX
    workstations. The subsequent release, Emacspeak-96 (code
    named Egypt) made available in May 1996 provided significant
    enhancements to the interface. Emacspeak-97 (Tennessee) went
    further in providing a true audio desktop. Emacspeak-98
    integrated Internetworking into all aspects of the audio
    desktop to provide the first fully interactive
    speech-enabled WebTop.</p>
