        In this essay, I suggest how to introduce Emacspeak to someone new,
        and I discuss some of the notions behind GNU Emacs, which underlies
        Emacspeak.

        In addition, the essay contains some comments on two software

  <h2 class="unnumbered">This Essay</h2>

  <p>In this essay, I will recommend that you and your friend read
  parts of the Emacspeak manual together, practice commands, and
  practice using the online help. In addition, I shall talk about
  the notions behind GNU Emacs, which underlies Emacspeak.</p>

  <p>Your friend may be permanently blind, partially blind, or like
  a car driver, situationally blind. Regardless of circumstance,
  your friend will find that Emacspeak is different from other user
  interfaces.</p>

  <p>You will notice that I keep mentioning `your friend'; of
  course, you may be introducing yourself to Emacspeak. This is not
  impossible. It is just harder. This is how I learned
  Emacspeak.</p>

  <p>The essay has six parts. The first four parts are the core.
  The fifth and sixth parts are about particular software
  text-to-speech synthesizers and about one method of
  installation.</p>

  <ol type="1" start="1">
    <li>Introduction

      <p>A short introductory segment, for orienting yourself. I
      ask two rhetorical questions.</p>
    </li>

    <li>The advice itself

      <p>This is the longest part.</p>
    </li>

    <li>A short digression: free books and music

      <p>How to download texts, such as <cite>Alice in
      Wonderland</cite>, from the Gutenberg Project.</p>
    </li>

    <li>A sample <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>
    initialization and customization file

      <p>I cannot imagine running Emacspeak without customizing
      it.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Two software text-to-speech synthesizers

      <p>A discussion of <code>eflite</code> and
      <code>espeakf</code>. When I first wrote this in April 2003,
      I had problems with them. Now, in March 2006, they are good
      enough.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Emacspeak Installation

      <p>This is a section on installing Emacspeak in Debian with
      both <code>eflite</code> and <code>espeakf</code>. Even
      though I am now running two instances of Emacspeak, one using
      <code>eflite</code> and the other using <code>espeakf</code>,
      I am least certain about this part. This is because so much
      of my Emacs and other installation is from sources rather
      than from standard, precompiled binaries. I don't know what a
      standard Debian or standard Emacspeak installation involves.
      I think what I describe is correct; but am not sure.</p>

  <h2 class="unnumbered">Questions to Help Orient Yourself</h2>

  <p>My first question is whether you already know and use
  Emacspeak and are introducing someone else to an already running
  Emacspeak with which you have experience, or whether you are the
  new user and must not only learn to use Emacspeak yourself, but
  must also install it? (I know there are other alternatives, but
  these are critical.)</p>

  <p>My hope is that you are the first: that you, the reader, are
  someone who already knows and uses Emacspeak and are introducing
  it to someone else; but my fear is that you are the second. The
  second path is harder.</p>

  <p>I will mention installation again after introducing Emacspeak,
  talking about some of the underlying notions behind GNU Emacs,
  and several other matters. But first, I would like to ask you
  what kind of text-to-speech facility you have?</p>

  <p>Are you using an external synthesizer, an internal hardware
  card for <dfn>text-to-speech</dfn> generation or do you expect to
  use a software text-to-speech package such as <code>eflite</code>
  or <code>espeakf</code>? I do not have a hard synthesizer, but
  run both those two software packages. In the installation
  section, I will talk about them.</p>

  <p>Emacspeak was originally written for an external hardware
  DecTalk synthesizer attached to a serial port. I am told that a
  hardware synthesizer is better, whether internal or external, and
  that if you can, you should use one. However, you can also use a
  software text-to-speech program.</p>

  <p>This means that you can run Emacspeak on any computer that has
  sound, as do most contemporary personal computers. You can try
  out Emacspeak without first investing in special hardware.
  However, it is also worth bearing in mind that at the time I am
  writing this, in May 2005, <code>eflite</code> and
  <code>espeakf</code> have different virtues. Neither is as good
  as it might be. For example, my installation of
  <code>espeakf</code> sometimes restarts its speaking of
  punctuation after I shift back to a buffer, but not always. On
  the other hand <code>espeakf</code> has voices, which I really
  like. All in all, the two software synthesizers are good
  enough.</p>

  <h2 class="unnumbered">How to Introduce Emacspeak</h2>

  <p>Let me hope that you, the reader, already know and use
  Emacspeak and are introducing it to someone else. You may not be
  that person, but I will write this section as if you are. You are
  introducing a friend to Emacspeak.</p>

  <p>First of all, in Info, please listen together with your friend
  to the beginnings of the Emacspeak manual. You might want to
  start with the Introduction node. It is well written. See
  <a href="emacspeak.html#Introduction">Introduction</a>. You can
  use the opportunity to introduce various Emacspeak commands and
  to discuss the philosophy or world-view behind Emacspeak.</p>

  <p>You can also explain the meaning of some of the jargon, such
  as `point' to mean the place in the text where commands operate,
  `visit' to mean opening a file in a buffer, and `string' to mean
  a `string of characters'.</p>

  <p>Sighted people tend to work with the three contemporary user
  interfaces: command line, graphical, and Emacs. Each is
  different.</p>

  <p>A key to Emacspeak is to understand that it provides a fourth
  type of user interface.</p>

  <p>Emacspeak is different from the shell command line interface
  that uses commands such as `ls'. It is different from a graphic
  user interface such as GNOME/sawfish that uses a package such as
  `Mozilla'. Moreover, although it is based on the virtual lisp
  machine interface that is GNU Emacs, it is different from it,
  too.</p>

  <p>Put another way, Emacs and Emacspeak are both integrated user
  interfaces, like a shell, plus `vi', plus `ls', plus `gdb', plus
  `gcc', and so on. While related to each other, they are also
  different.</p>

  <p>Emacspeak is a complete audio desktop; it is not a visual
  desktop. T. V. Raman describes it in his Emacspeak manual. See
  <a href="emacspeak.html#Top">Emacspeak</a>.</p>

  </div>

  <h3 class="unnumberedsec">Info and Help</h3>

  <p>Your friend will want to learn a great many keystroke
  commands, but if he is like me, he will continually forget them,
  too.</p>

  <p>So you need to teach him how to use Info, which is where he
  can listen to the Emacspeak manual. And you need to teach him how
  to use help. This way, he can always learn more, or relearn what
  he has forgot.</p>

  <p class="noindent">The first commands I learned were:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>Control-h Control-e</code></dt>

    <dd>
      Give a brief overview of Emacspeak.

      <p>I use this command all the time, to remind me of other
      commands.</p>

      <p>(In most Emacs documentation, this command,
      <code>Control-h Control-e</code> is written as <code>C-h
      C-e</code>.)<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>Control-e left-brace</code></dt>

    <dd>
      Speak paragraph.

      <p>With a prefix arg, speak the rest of the current
      paragraph. With a negative prefix arg, read from the start of
      the current paragraph to the current position, that is, to
      point.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>Control-u</code></dt>

    <dd>
      The <dfn>universal-argument</dfn>. This is the prefix arg.

      <p>Use as a prefix to some interactive commands, such as
      <kbd>Control-u&nbsp;Control-e&nbsp;left-brace</kbd> 
      <!-- /@w -->, which speaks the rest of the current
      paragraph.</p>

      <p>To read from the beginning of the current paragraph to
      point, type
      <kbd>Control-u&nbsp;hyphen&nbsp;one&nbsp;Control-e&nbsp;left-brace</kbd><!-- /@w -->.<br />
      </p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>Control-e left-angle-bracket</code></dt>

    <dd>
      Speak a page.

      <p>With a prefix arg, speak the rest of the current page.</p>

      <p>I often use the <kbd>Control-u Control-e
      left-angle-bracket</kbd> command.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>Control-e s</code></dt>

    <dd>Stop speech.<br /></dd>

    <dt><code>Control-h i</code></dt>

    <dd>
      Start Info.

      <p>In Info, press <kbd>h</kbd> for an Info
      tutorial.<br /></p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>Control-h t</code></dt>

    <dd>Start the Emacs Tutorial.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Your friend will also need to learn the regular movement and
  search keys. The Emacs Tutorial is good for this. But first teach
  him how to listen to Info and to use the online help.</p>

  <p>Note that the Emacs Tutorial contains left and right angle
  brackets in two places. To hear them in Emacspeak, you must set
  the punctuation mode to all, with the command:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     Control-e d p all RET
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">Otherwise, the brackets will not be spoken.
  (The &lt;RET&gt; at the end of the command means to press the
  Return key after typing all.)</p>

  <p>In most Emacs documentation, a command such as Control-e
  left-brace command is written as <code>C-e {</code>. If you are
  listening in Emacspeak, you have to set the punctuation mode to
  all; otherwise, you will not hear the left-brace spoken.</p>

  </div>

  <h3 class="unnumberedsec">Movement</h3>

  <p>As for movement: incremental search is the most important way
  of moving around documents. This command is bound to
  <kbd>Control-s</kbd>, which is usually written as <kbd>C-s</kbd>.
  Often people do not think of a search command as a movement
  command, but it is.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Emacs incremental search provides the single best
  user interface for a search command that exists. Many other
  search commands require that you figure out your search string
  before you type, which means that the search fails when you type
  too little. Incremental search is nicer to use.</p>

  <p>The character and word movement keys, and the character and
  word deletion keys, are reasonably easy for English speakers to
  learn, since they use English language mnemonics:
  <kbd>Control-f</kbd> to move forward a character,
  <kbd>Meta-f</kbd> to move forward a word. (Meta-f is usually
  written as <kbd>M-f</kbd>.) p is for previous, n is for next, b
  is for backwards, and d is for delete.</p>

  <p>Control key commands are often (but not always) for character
  movement; Meta key commands are often (but not always) for word
  movement.</p>

  </div>

  <h3 class="unnumberedsec">Keybindings</h3>

  <p>You will want to explain the use of Meta. You might tell your
  friend that on many modern keyboards, a Meta key is what is now,
  generally and erroneously, labeled Alt, spelled A&nbsp;L&nbsp;T 
  <!-- /@w -->, and usually written &lt;ALT&gt;. (Genuine Alt keys
  can and do exist; but the default keybinding for many machines
  automatically makes the key labeled Alt be a Meta key. Naturally,
  you should set up the machine so that a key labeled Alt takes on
  a Meta keybinding, for example with the <samp><span class=
  "command">install-keymap&nbsp;emacs2</span></samp><!-- /@w -->
   command.)</p>

  <p>Worse, in some cases, people press the Escape key to simulate
  a Meta keypress. The Escape key is usually written &lt;ESC&gt;.
  No one in their right mind uses an Escape key, unless forced by a
  really old keyboard.</p>

  <p>While I am speaking of keybindings, and to be complete, please
  be sure the control key is the key to the left of the A key. This
  is something you should set up; you don't need to explain any of
  this.</p>

  <p>You may have to change the keybinding. On some keyboards, the
  key to the left of the A key is labeled Caps_Lock. It is as if
  the keyboard manufacturers think that computers are typewriters
  from 1885. Moreover, they put the key labeled Control in an
  awkward spot, and then provide default keybindings that match the
  labels. You have to change the keybindings.</p>

  <p>Generally, the proper keymap is in</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     /usr/share/keymaps/i386/qwerty/emacs2.kmap.gz
<br /><span class=
"roman">or</span><br />     /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/i386/qwerty/emacs2.kmap.gz
</pre>

  <p>You can install the keymap permanently on your system for a
  console with the shell command:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     install-keymap emacs2
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">(This may be a Debian specific command; it
  copies the <samp><span class="file">emacs2.kmap.gz</span></samp>
  file to the <samp><span class=
  "file">/etc/console/boottime.kmap.gz</span></samp> file, which is
  loaded into the kernel at boot-time. The older and widely used
  command is <samp><span class="command">loadkeys</span></samp>;
  when you run it, you have to specify the full path to the
  file.</p>

  <p>(For example, to install the proper keymap, you might type</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     loadkeys /usr/share/keymaps/i386/qwerty/emacs2.kmap.gz
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">(Note that since files in the
  <samp><span class="file">/usr/</span></samp> directory are
  sometimes not available early during the boot process, it is a
  good idea to copy the <samp><span class=
  "file">/usr/share/keymaps/i386/qwerty/emacs2.kmap.gz</span></samp>
  to the <samp><span class=
  "file">/etc/console/boottime.kmap.gz</span></samp> file. This is
  what the <samp><span class="command">install-keymap</span></samp>
  command does. If you don't have an <samp><span class=
  "command">install-keymap</span></samp> command, you can copy the
  file yourself and put a <samp><span class=
  "command">loadkeys&nbsp;/etc/console/boottime.kmap.gz</span></samp><!-- /@w -->
   command into one of your boot scripts.)</p>

  <h3 class="unnumberedsec">X Windows Keybindings</h3>

  <p>If you are using an X Windows graphical user interface, you
  may need to specify the keymap that X uses in addition to
  specifying the keymap used by a console.</p>

  <p>You can put the following commands in your
  <code>~/.xsession</code> or <code>~/.xinitrc</code> file:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     xmodmap -e "clear Lock"
     xmodmap -e "add Control = Caps_Lock"
</pre>

  <p>Some systems reverse the meaning of the Help key, which is
  <kbd>Control-h</kbd>, and the Delete key. The node
  <samp><span class="file">Keyboard Translations</span></samp> in
  the <cite>Emacs manual</cite> describes what to do.</p>

  <p>You can go directly to that node in Info by evaluating the
  following expression, that is to say, by positioning point after
  the final parenthesis and typing <kbd>Control-x Control-e</kbd>,
  which is usually written as <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd>:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     (info "(emacs)Keyboard Translations")
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">(Please remember to note my use of the jargon
  word `point'; it needs to be explained as the place in the text
  where editing commands operate.)</p>

  <h3 class="unnumberedsec">Setting the Speech Rate</h3>

  <p>Returning to what you might talk about early on with your
  friend:</p>

  <p>He may want to set the voice synthesizer speech rate. I use
  both the <samp><span class=
  "command">dtk-set-predefined-speech-rate</span></samp>
  command:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     Control-e d 1
     Control-e d 2
     Control-e d 3
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">and the <samp><span class=
  "command">dtk-set-rate</span></samp> command, such as</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     Control-e d r 230 RET
</pre>

  <p>Probably it is a good idea to pick one of these commands. Two
  sets of commands may overload his memory.</p>

  <p>As he gains more experience, your friend will be able to
  understand text spoken faster and faster, and will want to
  increase its speed.</p>

  <p>Note that in both set-rate commands, an interactive prefix
  means to set the speech rate globally. Otherwise, it is set only
  for the current buffer.</p>

  <p>Your friend may want to set rates globally, so it is worth
  telling him about typing <kbd>Control-u</kbd> first.</p>

  <h3 class="unnumberedsec">Basic Commands Reference</h3>

  <p>For a description of the basic commands, see the node
  `Reading' in the Info file emacspeak.info</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     (info "(emacspeak)Reading")
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">(As I said earlier, you can go directly to
  that node by evaluating the Emacs Lisp expression: position point
  after the final parenthesis and type <kbd>Control-x
  Control-e</kbd>.)</p>

  <p>Perhaps evaluation is too much too soon, since it means
  remembering a new command as well as figuring out where `point'
  is. On the other hand, I think it is worth illustrating the
  action, since it opens up future possibilities.</p>

  <p>Incidentally, you can go directly to the Introduction node of
  the Emacspeak manual by evaluating:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     (info "(emacspeak)Introduction")
</pre>

  <p>My hope is that you will inspire your friend to experiment
  with many commands and learn a few of them; you will inspire him
  to learn how to use the help features, to listen to the Emacspeak
  Info manual, and then to listen to the Emacs manual.</p>

  <p>After that, he can start using Emacs W3 or Emacs W3M mode to
  browse the Web, Emacs RMAIL mode to listen to Email, and Emacs
  mail mode to send it. You may need to make sure his machine is
  properly configured for all this.</p>

  <h3 class="unnumberedsec">Characteristics of GNU Emacs</h3>

  <p>While listening to the Emacspeak Info manual, it is worth
  explaining some of the problems people have with the Emacs
  manual, to which he should listen next, or at least listen to
  part of it. I do not recommend listening to it all at once.</p>

  <p>The Emacs manual is tightly written. When I first read it, I
  found I sometimes had to spend several minutes puzzling out a
  concise meaning. The good news is that it is accurate and well
  written. And after you understand it, the sentences make perfect
  sense.</p>

  <p>When I first started, I read the manual in segments over 2
  years. (This was in the 1980s.) I did not understand all that I
  could do at first. Indeed, for the longest time, I did not switch
  from using `ls -al' in a command line to using Dired mode.</p>

  <p>Some people say that the Emacs learning curve is steep.</p>

  <p>In my experience, this is not true. It took me about five
  minutes to start to use Emacs productively. But I could not and
  did not do much at first, except write.</p>

  <p>However, the learning curve will be steep if you try all at
  once to use many of the features that Emacs provides. I have
  described GNU Emacs as</p>

  <blockquote class="c1">
    <small class="dots">...</small> like having a dragon's cave of
    treasures.
  </blockquote>

  <p>You should not try to be too greedy and over-stuff yourself
  all one sitting.</p>

  <p>(That quotation is from the Info node "On Reading this Text"
  in the Info manual that introduces programming in Emacs Lisp:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     (info "(eintr)On Reading this Text")
</pre>

  <p>I wrote that text "as an elementary introduction for people
  who are not programmers", but presupposed experience with Emacs.
  So I doubt you or your friend will want to look at it early on.
  But I hope that he will keep it in mind for the future.)</p>

  <h3 class="unnumberedsec">Peculiarities of the Emacs manual</h3>

  <p>To listen to the Emacs manual in Emacspeak, you will need to
  set the punctuation mode to all with the command:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     Control-e d p all RET
</pre>

  <p>RMS, Richard M. Stallman, wrote the Emacs manual.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, RMS thinks of editing as having a very large
  meaning. He writes as if using <samp><span class=
  "command">ls</span></samp> and <samp><span class=
  "command">rm</span></samp> in a command line is the shell
  equivalent of editing in Emacspeak. People who use a shell do not
  think of this as editing.</p>

  <p>However, if you think about it, you will discover that the
  Emacspeak actions in Dired mode are a kind of editing. Indeed,
  the name Dired is a contraction for the phrase `directory
  editor'.</p>

  <p>But the kind of editing that goes on in Dired is not same kind
  of editing as people do in an editor like <samp><span class=
  "command">vi</span></samp> when they press the <kbd>h</kbd>,
  <kbd>j</kbd>, <kbd>k</kbd>, and <kbd>l</kbd> keys to move around.
  People are fooled by the language.</p>

  <p>The words <dfn>mode</dfn> and <dfn>library</dfn> are not
  confusing, but may not be understood immediately. The two provide
  the features that programs have in other interfaces. Thus Dired
  mode provides the same features in Emacs that the combination of
  <samp><span class="command">ls</span></samp>, <samp><span class=
  "command">mv</span></samp>, <samp><span class=
  "command">chown</span></samp>, <samp><span class=
  "command">chgrp</span></samp>, <samp><span class=
  "command">gzip</span></samp>, <samp><span class=
  "command">more</span></samp>, <samp><span class=
  "command">vi</span></samp>, and <samp><span class=
  "command">rm</span></samp> provide in a shell. A library provides
  a mode.</p>

  <p>Because of the adoption of Xerox Parc style windowing systems
  over the past generation, many people are confused by Emacs' use
  of the words window and frame. Emacs provides for multiple
  windows within a frame, as it always has.</p>

  <p>You will probably not use a graphic user interface at all; but
  enough people do that you will hear what they say.</p>

  <p>Nowadays, sighted people often think of a window on a computer
  screen as being a contiguous, usually rectangular space, what in
  Emacs is called a frame. That is because Emacs was designed
  initially to fill a complete display as a tiling window manager.
  (A tiling window manager is one in which windows do not overlap,
  but are contiguous, like physical tiles.) Parts of the display
  were called windows because they enabled a sighted person to look
  at all or part of a buffer.</p>

  <p>Companies like Apple and Sun, and the X Consortium, copied
  Emacs jargon for their own windows, to mean a part of a screen.
  (Or else the notion of a window was generic and commonplace.)</p>

  <p>Thus, the term window started out and continues to mean a part
  of a display.</p>

  <p>But when Apple, Sun, and the X Consortium, and their
  followers, adopted the term window to mean a part of a display,
  they lacked a term to handle a part of a window. (The word `pane'
  was suggested, but never popular, because it sounds similar to
  the word `pain', spelled p&nbsp;a&nbsp;i&nbsp;n <!-- /@w -->, and
  because some people were accustomed to material windows that were
  not made up of multiple `panes of glass'.)</p>

  <p>However, in those days, mostly the 1980s, windows seldom
  contained parts, other than a menu or tool bar or panel that
  applied to a whole window. Thus, one spreadsheet would appear in
  one window; one file would appear in another.</p>

  <p>Indeed, many of the non-Emacs programs I use today in a
  graphic user interface still tend to put one set of contents,
  with its associated panels and tool bars, into one window: for
  example, XMMS, Mozilla, or <samp><span class=
  "command">gnome-apt</span></samp>.</p>

  <p>With Emacs, on the other hand, you could always put a
  directory listing, two files, and an email message into four
  different parts of an Apple or X style window (although most
  people keep to one or two parts most of the time). These
  different parts had always been themselves called windows, and so
  they remained. Hence, the invention of the term frame to refer to
  a segment of a display as produced by an X or Sun user interface
  program.</p>

  <p>Nowadays, you can start different frames in an instance of
  Emacspeak that is not running in a graphical user interface. One
  frame overlies another. The mode line will tell you which frame
  you are in. (Type <kbd>Control-e m</kbd> to listen to the mode
  line. That key chord calls the <samp><span class=
  "command">emacspeak-speak-mode-line</span></samp> command. The
  frame number is listed in the second and subsequent frames.)</p>

  <p>Emacs jargon can be brutal. Some people are upset by the use
  of the word `kill' to mean `cut' as in `cut and paste'. (The word
  `cut' also upsets some people, but generally less than the word
  `kill'.) In Emacs, an entity `killed' can be resurrected, which I
  think of as a Christian form of meaning.</p>

  <p>Some years ago, at the transition from Emacs version 18 to
  version 19, I offered to convert every use in Emacs of the word
  <code>kill</code> to <code>clip</code>. There were more than 400
  such uses. You could <code>clip</code> a segment of text, and if
  it were never put back, it would be deleted. Alternatively, you
  could yank the segment from the <code>clip-ring</code>. I picked
  <code>clip</code> as the replacement word since it has four
  letters and fits the older formatting and language without
  requiring much rewriting.</p>

  <p>Moreover, had I changed the term to `cut', people would have
  expected me to replace the word <code>yank</code> with `paste',
  to fit the phrase `cut and paste'. But I do not like the word
  `paste'; I no longer literally paste clips onto a sheet of paper
  as I did when I was young. It makes more sense to me to
  <code>yank</code> a segment back from the
  <code>clip-ring</code>.</p>

  <p>However, RMS never wanted me to make the replacement. I think
  part of the reason is that at that time, RMS still enjoyed what I
  think of as a dead joke: the manual for version 18 Emacs
  said:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <small class="dots">...</small> you don't have to kill all the
    text in one command; you can keep killing line after line, or
    word after word, until you have killed it all, and you can
    still get it all back at once. (Thus we join television in
    leading people to kill thoughtlessly.)
  </blockquote>

  <p class="noindent">(The parenthetical remark about television
  was removed sometime later and the other wording slightly
  improved.)</p>

  <p>Perhaps more significantly, RMS asked many people whether they
  were bothered by the jargon use of <code>kill</code>. They said
  `no'. It turned out that RMS asked people he thought of as
  significant, namely people at M.I.T. I think that was too narrow
  a group. But that is what happened, and I still think it was a
  mistake.</p>

  <p>Most important of all, please emphasize and explain that
  Emacspeak is safer than many programs. What you write is
  automatically saved to disk. This means you can work with
  unreliable power supplies, or learn by trying out new things and
  make what otherwise would be catastrophic mistakes.</p>

  <p>You can experiment and learn.</p>

  <p>With Emacspeak, you can listen to your email, browse the Web,
  write reports, programs, novels, and poetry.</p>

  <p>You may also want to download various books, documents, and
  audio recordings from the Gutenberg Project archive, such as Jane
  Austen's novel <cite>Pride and Prejudice</cite>.</p>

  <p>You can visit the archive directory using W3 mode or W3M mode
  at</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/
</pre>

  <p>I just typed</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     Meta-x w3m-goto-url
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">and then the URL to reach that directory.
  (Well, actually, I typed</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     Meta-x w3m-got
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">and then pressed return. Emacs automatically
  completed the name of the command, so I did not have to do so
  much typing. And I copied the long URL listed above into the
  minibuffer so I did not have to type it. I hate typing and avoid
  it as much as possible.)</p>

  <p>The index is</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     GUTINDEX.ALL
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">and you can download it using W3M mode by
  positioning point on the name and pressing the return key. (There
  are other ways of downloading it, too; this is one of them.)</p>

  <p>As I write this in March 2006, the Gutenberg Project index is
  2 megabytes long and lists more than ten thousand books,
  documents, and audio recordings. I saved my copy to a file, since
  I dislike long downloads.</p>

  <p>You may want to use Emacspeak to listen to <cite>Pride and
  Prejudice</cite>, <cite>Alice in Wonderland</cite>, <cite>The
  Federalist Papers</cite> or other of the Gutenberg books,
  documents, and music.</p>

  <p>The text files from the Gutenberg Project that I have
  downloaded use the DOS `<samp><span class="samp">carriage-return
  linefeed</span></samp>' convention to mark ends of lines rather
  than the Unix `<samp><span class="samp">newline</span></samp>'
  convention. This does not really matter since Emacspeak
  automatically detects the convention and visits the file using
  the DOS end-of-line coding format.</p>

  <p>However, I prefer the Unix end-of-line format. After visiting
  a file, I run the <samp><span class=
  "command">set-buffer-file-coding-system</span></samp> command on
  it:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     Control-x RET f unix RET

  that I like.</p>

  <p>The following <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp>

  <h2 class="unnumbered">Two Software text-to-speech
  Synthesizers</h2>

  <p>At the time I write this in May 2005, I am running two
  instances of Emacspeak, one using the <code>eflite</code>
  software text-to-speech synthesizer and the other using the
  <code>espeakf</code> software text-to-speech synthesizer.</p>

  <p>The current <code>espeakf</code> provides different voices,
  which my current version of <code>eflite</code> lacks. Also, in
  my set up, it sometimes speaks pronunciation when it should not;
  but not always.</p>

  <p>I prefer <code>espeakf</code>.</p>

  <p>At the moment, I am using two different Emacspeak commands,
  one for starting Emacspeak with <code>eflite</code> and the other
  for starting Emacspeak with <code>espeakf</code>. Right now, I am
  running both, each as its own instance of Emacspeak.</p>

  <p>The two starting commands are:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     emacspeak-eflite
     
     emacspeak-espeak
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">The two commands are shell scripts in the
  /usr/local/bin/ directory.</p>

  <p>The regular Emacspeak command is in the /usr/bin/ directory,
  but since these two commands are experimental, I am putting them
  into the /usr/local/bin/ directory, to remind me that I created
  them locally.</p>

  <p>(Incidentally, I am also running two other non-Emacspeak
  instances of Emacs: an experimental Emacs version 22 owned by
  user `bob', and an Emacs version 20.7 owned by user `root'. That
  way, I separate dangerous system administration task from
  ordinary work.)</p>

  <h2 class="unnumbered">Installation: Debian and
  <code>espeakf</code></h2>

  <p>Regarding installation: if you have not installed Emacspeak
  recently, and plan to install the package again soon for someone
  else, please practice a reinstall first. Perhaps, nowadays, all
  will go well; but perhaps not.</p>

  <p>In the past, I have had troubles with Emacspeak installation,
  although in 2003 and more recently, everything has gone well. I
  am sighted, and do not depend on Emacspeak, so perhaps I
  continually renew my ignorance.</p>

  <p>In addition to a computer with a sound system, Emacspeak
  requires three packages:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>GNU Emacs,</li>

    <li>Emacspeak, and</li>

    <li>a text-to-speech synthesizer.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>A hardware text-to-speech synthesizer is best, but I do not
  have one. Instead I use two different software text-to-speech
  synthesizers, both of which are immature programs that make use
  of the more basic Festival text-to-speech program.</p>

  <p>Installation is extensively described in the Emacspeak manual.
  See <a href="emacspeak.html#Installation">Installation</a>.</p>

  <p>Also, James R. Van Zandt has written an installation HOWTO
  that is now maintained by Sharon Snider. It is in the Emacspeak
  sources and on the Web at <a href=
  "http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Emacspeak-HOWTO/">http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Emacspeak-HOWTO/</a>.</p>

  <p>Please consider building and installing your software from
  source. This process is straightforward and I have done this in
  the past with great success.</p>

  <p>However, I am going to describe only what you do to install
  <code>espeakf</code>, which is not in Debian, and what you do in
  Debian to install <code>eflite</code>. The process should be
  simple, but for some reason, possibly because I tend to use
  unstable, experimental software, I have not always found it
  so.</p>

  <p>In Debian, as of April 2003, to install Emacspeak using the
  eflite software text-to-speech synthesizer, type the following in
  a shell:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     apt-get install emacs21 emacs21-el emacspeak eflite
</pre>

  <p>The <samp><span class="file">emacs21-el</span></samp> package
  contains the Emacs Lisp source files that Emacs uses. In theory,
  you can run Emacs without them, but I have found them essential,
  if only for the extra documentation and commentary they provide.
  It does not matter if some of the packages are already installed
  or will be installed automatically.</p>

  <p>After running <samp><span class=
  "command">apt-get</span></samp>, you should be able to run
  Emacspeak by typing</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     emacspeak
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">in a shell. That command is a shell script in
  <samp><span class="file">/usr/bin/emacspeak</span></samp>.</p>

  <p>In theory, that is all there is to it. And if you are not
  using the awkward, non-standard system that I am, but instead are
  using a well configured, modern, standard system, what I just
  told you should work.</p>

  <p>Since I run both the <code>eflite</code> and
  <code>espeakf</code> text-to-speech synthesizers, and at this
  stage am running them in what amounts to a local experiment, I
  copied the shell script that starts Emacspeak with eflite from
  the /usr/bin/ directory to the /usr/local/bin/ directory and
  renamed it to <samp><span class=
  "file">/usr/local/bin/emacspeak-eflite</span></samp>.</p>

  <p>I start Emacspeak with <code>espeakf</code> with a different
  shell script, called <samp><span class=
  "file">/usr/local/bin/emacspeak-epeakf</span></samp>. (These
  names are not very imaginative, but I can remember them.)</p>

  <p><code>espeakf</code> is available from CVS on SourceForge.
  Fortunately, it is easy to download and install.</p>

  <p>First you need to decide on a directory in which you plan to
  keep the <code>espeakf</code> directory that you will download. I
  use</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     /usr/local/src/
</pre>

  <p>Make that directory if you do not have it already, then go to
  it.</p>

  <p>Here are the commands, which I run as the non-privileged user
  `<samp><span class="samp">bob</span></samp>' in a shell, such as
  one in Emacspeak that you can start with the <kbd>Meta-x
  term</kbd> command.</p>

  <p>This facility is described in</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     (info "(emacspeak)Running Terminal Based Applications")
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">(Before you try <kbd>Meta-x term</kbd>, be
  sure to learn how to get out of the buffer! In Term mode, the
  usual commands for killing a buffer or switching buffers do not
  work. I find <kbd>Control-c Control-f</kbd>, the new keybinding
  for <code>find-file</code> useful, as well as <kbd>Control-c
  k</kbd>, which kills the buffer.)</p>

  <p>In a shell, I first switch to the appropriate directory, and
  then I run the CVS login command:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     cd /usr/local/src/
     cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.espeakf.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/espeakf login
</pre>

  <p>You need to login once for CVS. The login command will ask for
  your password. Just press your return key. Then, type the
  following command:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.espeakf.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/espeakf co espeakf
</pre>

  <p>These commands will create a <samp><span class=
  "file">/usr/local/src/espeakf/</span></samp> directory below your
  <samp><span class="file">/usr/local/src/</span></samp> directory
  and fill it with several files and other directories. To make use
  of the <code>espeakf</code> text-to-speech synthesizer, Emacspeak
  runs an executable Perl script called <code>espeakf.pl</code>.
  CVS installs that Perl script properly, so you do not need to do
  anything.</p>

  <p>However, you do need to modify your <samp><span class=
  "file">/usr/local/bin/emacspeak-eflite</span></samp> and
  <samp><span class=
  "file">/usr/local/bin/emacspeak-espeakf</span></samp> start up
  scripts for the two different text-to-speech synthesizers.</p>

  <p>I use a variation on the <code>/usr/bin/emacspeak</code>
  script that Emacspeak creates automatically. That script uses
  information from a <samp><span class=
  "file">/etc/emacspeak.conf</span></samp> file. I ignore that
  configuration file because the configuration for Emacspeak with
  the two synthesizers is different. Instead, I put all the
  configuration information into the two <samp><span class=
  "file">/usr/local/bin/</span></samp> scripts.</p>

  <p>The two scripts contain sharp signs, exclamation marks, left
  and right brackets, and much else. To listen to all the
  characters in them, you need to set Emacspeak's punctuation mode
  to all. If you are listening to this in Emacspeak, you can
  evaluate the following expression by placing point after it and
  typing <kbd>Control-x Control-e</kbd>:</p>
  <pre class="smallexample">
     (dtk-set-punctuations 'all)
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">First, the <samp><span class=
  "file">/usr/local/bin/emacspeak-eflite</span></samp> script.</p>
