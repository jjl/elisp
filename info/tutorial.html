    this link. The speech synthesizer used in Vinux installations
    of Emacspeak is Espeak. Adjust any references to Words per
    minute, pitch and so forth to the speech synthesizer of your
    choice. Also, while Vinux is the distribution whose users are
    targeted in this tutorial, some pains were taken to make
    instructions as distro-independent as possible. Exceptions to
    this include but are not limited to using synaptic package
    manager to install packages and instructions to type "sudo" in
    the command line for things requiring root permissions as this
    is how such things are done in Ubuntu which is what Vinux is
    based upon as of this writing.</p>

      Introduction</h2>

      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
        <p>In past years, there have been quite a few excellent
        reference materials written on Emacspeak by its author, Dr.
        T. V. Raman, and by other members of its user community.
        Because of this, I will tell you right now that I won't try
        to reproduce their work since for one thing, I can't hope
        to equal the job they did much less top it, and for
        another, I find writing reference materials to be a rather
        boring and tedious business best left to the pros. No, dear
        reader, this is something far simpler and far more
        digestible. What we have here is a no frills Emacspeak
        how-to or tutorial if you will permit such a term whose
        main purpose is to tell you what you need to know and do to
        accomplish something productive within 5 minutes of
        launching it. So, it's going to be very non-technical and
        very superficial. Because of this, there will be many
        places where you are encouraged to refer to the Info Pages
        or to another on line resource that does provide that
        technical information so you can consult it and really
        start learning this amazing application. It is my
        conviction that you will be quite unable to truly realize
        your productive potential until you have tinkered with it a
        bit and learned a thing or two about how it works under the
        hood. This is Linux, after all where a look under the hood
        of any application is a must from time to time. I hope you
        find this tutorial useful and that it helps you get past
        the usual hurdles newcomers to Emacspeak face. If there is
        anything you would like included in future versions, e-mail
        me directly or send an e-mail to the vinux support group at
        <a href=
        "mailto:vinux-support@googlegroups.com">vinux-support@googlegroups.com</a>.</p>

        <h3 id="sec-1_1"><span class="section-number-3">1.1</span>
        Who is this for?</h3>

        <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1_1">
          <p>This tutorial is for anyone who is interested in
          adding another accessibility tool to their assistive tool
          chest whether they come from Windows, Mac or Linux. A lot
          of thought has gone into how to introduce this tool to
          people who are coming from GUI environments. Because of
          this, it will deviate from the usual path and ease you
          into hotkeys by first showing you the menu system of
          Emacs. We will also talk about movement and navigation
          using more common naming conventions such as the ones you
          would find in Gnome, Windows or Mac. This is because
          these days, the overwhelming majority of blind people use
          Windows and the screen readers that make it accessible.
          Gone are the days when most of us were command line users
          though, we have not entirely lost our love for the mighty
          hotkey. So, don't think the hotkeys will be ignored. Far
          from it since the menus in Emacs are its training wheels
          and you can't really start doing things quickly until you
          have learned at least the basic hotkeys. Learning hotkeys
          takes time though and, meanwhile, you actually want to DO
          something as in right now without having to feel like a
          schoolboy or girl memorizing lines for some poem or play
          or something like that. This is why menus will be talked
          about a lot.</p>

          <p>What this tutorial will not teach you is how to use
          Linux in general. That topic is huge and far too
          encompassing to cover here. If you come across terms you
          don't understand or have never heard before, I want you
          to make extensive use of Google, info, and the man pages.
          If there is one lesson which is Linux-wide which I will
          teach you, it is this:</p>

          <p>Linux does not hand everything to you on a silver
          platter ready for you to just pick up a fork and dig in.
          This is especially true of information. It assumes you
          are smart enough to learn through research and that you
          are capable of thinking for yourself. This is pretty much
          the modus operandi across all flavors of it and in much
          of the software that runs on it. Inevitably, it will
          manifest itself in the people who use it as well. In more
          extreme cases, some Linux users can come across as testy
          and unhelpful geeks from a newbie's perspective when they
          are asked what they feel are simple questions whose
          answers aren't hard to find with a little effort on the
          part of the inquirer. It is because they assume that you
          are smart enough to use a search engine, browse forums,
          read help files and tinker a bit to solve your problem.
          It is what they did, after all, and they figure you can
          do the same. They can usually tell when you haven't based
          on your questions so, research before you ask or be frank
          in admitting that you haven't and why because this is
          expected of you in this environment much more so than in
          Windows or Mac where you paid money therefore you have
          some rights when it comes to support. Many are
          particularly touchy about whether or not people read help
          files or manuals since they might have put time and
          effort into writing that stuff and don't feel like
          repeating themselves when they've made their help
          available to you in this form. Writing this stuff isn't
          easy and the overwhelming majority of those of us who
          write tutorials, man pages, help files and documentation
          don't get paid a single solitary cent for our efforts.
          The best pay in the world someone who puts their time and
          mental resources into writing an informational resource
          for no monetary compensation can get is for someone to
          use that resource thereby making their time and efforts
          worthwhile. "Hint hint
          &Atilde;&cent;&acirc;&sbquo;&not;&Acirc;&brvbar; nudge,
          nudge, know what I mean?" Please tell me you know Monty
          Python! Ok, enough rabbit trails.</p>

          <p>So, while this document will hold your hand in parts
          to some extent in order to minimize some of the infamous
          Emacs/Emacspeak learning curve, I will not insult your
          intelligence by over explaining when I know perfectly
          well that you are capable enough to read and research
          other sources on your own nor will I seek to duplicate
          the work done by others when there are lots of perfectly
          serviceable sources of information on just about any and
          all topics I covered here. In spite of this, you may
          decide that there is something missing or something can
          be made better and you are the one who can make that
          happen whereupon, you roll up your sleeves, stock up on
          caffeine and turn your back on Morpheus' restful embrace
          for a night or two while you make your contribution. If
          you do, then, be welcome among us for you are become one

        How best to use this Tutorial</h3>

        <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1_2">
          <p>The best way to use this tutorial is to read it using
          an application and in an environment you already know
          well such as note pad or, Internet Explorer in Windows
          with your favorite screen reader or a text editor like
          Gedit or the Firefox browser in Gnome with Orca as the
          screen reader or, maybe Nano or Vim in the Linux Console
          with Speakup. Mac users, I am sorry, I don't know Mac at
          all so I am afraid it'll be up to you to decide which
          editor works best for you on your end. If you are using a
          browser with a screen reader to access this in its html
          form, you can navigate quickly through major chapters by
          using whatever key your screen reader designates for
          level 2 headings. I do not recommend you try reading this
          tutorial in Emacspeak if you don't know anything about it
          since you'll spend most of your time trying to move
          around in it and won't be able to focus on the content as
          easily. This might cause you some frustration and the
          whole point of this is to make things easier on you so
          you don't give up when you first make contact with
          Emacspeak. It's got a very unique way of doing things
          and, it can take some getting used to at first.</p>

          <p>Another thing to note is that this document is not a
          replacement for reading the Emacspeak user's manual and
          the Emacs User's manual and certainly not for going
          through the Emacs Tutorial. These are all very valuable
          resources and you would be very well-advised to put them
          to use. In fact, if you are already running Linux, you
          can take a gander at the Emacs user's manual by typing
          info Emacs at the command line and browsing through it
          there. It'll make you want to try stuff and this is a
          good thing.</p>

        What is Emacs and obtaining information on it through
        Info.</h3>

        <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1_3">
          <p>So, what is Emacs? I thought we were learning about
          Emacspeak here. Well, Emacs is the application which
          Emacspeak causes to talk and react in a way that is more
          productive and efficient for someone using speech to
          interact with their computer. Ok, so what is Emacs then?
          You will find lots and lots of definitions and
          descriptions of it on line claiming all sorts of things
          about it from calling it a superb editor, or a desktop to
          calling it a bloated piece of software that doesn't
          compare to whatever else that person thinks is awesome
          and cool. Honestly, though, Emacs is a text editor that
          got extended and enhanced to such an extent that it will
          now do just about anything you want to do on a machine.
          It will let you edit since it's never stopped being a
          superb text editor. It will play music for you, brows the
          web, send e-mail, organize your life for you, run a shell
          for you, help you write programs and webpages and on, and
          on, and on. It's because it can do all this stuff that
          people refer to Emacs as a desktop even though it is
          still at its heart an editor. That's Editor with a
          capital E, mind. It is probably the single most powerful
          editor you will ever use. If you want to take a moment to
          read about the many uses to which you can put Emacs, you
          could hop online and read the <a href=
          "http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/index.html">
          web version of the Emacs manual</a> by following the link
          I just gave you.</p>

          <p>Emacs, believe it or not, is pretty easy to learn. It
          has a reputation for being newbie friendly. There are
          tons of resources inside of it and out on the web for
          learning how to use it and become productive quickly. For
          instance, <a href=
          "http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsNewbie">here is a
          nice page</a> dedicated specifically to newbies learning
          their way around Emacs. When you first bring it up and,
          for that matter, from anywhere within it, you always have
          the option of typing control h t and bringing up the
          Emacs Tutorial. Anyone who wants to learn to use Emacs
          should take this tutorial at first opportunity. I cannot
          recommend it strongly enough. This will show you how to
          move around in Emacs and walk you through a few basic
          editing commands. Even more help can be found inside the
          Info Pages. Info is the system Emacs uses to store its
          help files. They are browseable much like webpages are
          with hyperlinks and the like. In fact, before we go any
          further, let's talk about the help system a bit.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="outline-container-1_3_1" class="outline-4">
          <h4 id="sec-1_3_1"><span class=
          "section-number-4">1.3.1</span> The Emacs Help
          system</h4>

          <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1_3_1">
            <p>Emacs has been around a long time. Because of this,
            and thanks to the efforts of the man who wrote it, Mr.
            Richard M. Stallman of Gnu fame, and all the others who
            contributed, the help files are very extensive, very
            well-written and a valuable tool for anyone learning
            Emacs. To be honest, it is quite possibly one of the
            best documented pieces of software I have ever seen
            period. If you want to have a look at things before you
            bring up Emacs, you can type info emacs at the command
            line prompt and browse the help pages from there or, of
            course, you can browse them from within Emacs itself.
            To access the help system, you either select it using
            the menu bar, use a c-h combination, or by pressing m-x
            (meta x) and typing info. More on m-x later. Shortly,
            we will discuss getting help from the menu bar. Then,
            we'll have a look at some hotkey shortcuts to this
            information. First though, some naming conventions
            which will make your life easier:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Control key combinations: Anything requiring you
              to hold down the control key and press another key
              will be abbreviated as follows: c-h for control h,
              c-f for control f and so forth.</li>

              <li>Meta key combinations: Meta is a key assigned to
              the alt key in most keyboards. It is abbreviated the
              same way the control key is so, m-f and m-b are meta
              f and meta b. They are performed by holding down the
              alt key (meta) and pressing the other key indicated.
              M-f is alt+f in Windows-type lingo.</li>

              <li>Shift key combinations: You probably guessed this
              one. s followed by a dash is short for holding down
              shift and hitting something else. Most of the time,
              shift is held down in conjunction with something
              else. For instance, m-s-, is alt+shift+comma. These
              combinations are actually pretty rarely displayed as
              m-s-something. Usually, they tell you to hit
              m-something where that something can only be gotten
              to by hitting shift. For example, m-&lt; for top of
              buffer and m-&gt; for bottom of buffer. You can
              usually only get to the &lt; and &gt; signs by
              holding shift and hitting the comma and period
              respectively. So, m-s-, and m-s-. That takes forever
              to write hence the shortened form I told you
              about.</li>

              <li>Prefixes: To get around the problem of running
              out of hotkeys, Emacs has prefixes. Prefixes are
              hotkey combinations that make Emacs wait for a second
              or third key to execute something. For instance, c-e
              c-a. c-e is the Emacspeak prefix. c-a turns on
              auditory icons when preceded by this prefix. Another
              example is c-e d 5. c-e is the emacspeak prefix, d is
              the dtk speech sub prefix and the 5 is the present
              speech rate level 5. That one has 3 key combinations.
              This way, you can always have hotkeys for stuff
              without fear of your keyboard running out of keys to
              combine. Clever, huh? Here are three very common
              prefixes for you:

                <ul>
                  <li>c-e: This is the Emacspeak prefix. Anything
                  you want to run that has been put there as an
                  emacspeak-specific feature, you will access with
                  the c-e prefix and then the combination in
                  question. For instance, c-e c-a turns on your
                  auditory icons. Try it out, auditory icons are
                  like what Jaws users might call sound schemes.
                  Use them a bit and they become
                  self-explanatory.</li>

                  <li>c-u: Argument prefix. This one is way cool.
                  It lets you put in a numerical argument that
                  causes whatever you type next to repeat by how
                  many times the number you put in would require.
                  For instance, c-u 4 c-n makes you move down 4
                  lines. Emacspeak uses the argument prefix to make
                  changes global instead of local. For instance,
                  the c-e c-a combination we used earlier only
                  makes auditory icons turn on locally. To turn
                  them on globally, type c-u c-e c-a and you have
                  them on everywhere in Emacspeak.</li>

                  <li>c-c: This prefix is a generic prefix which
                  many other extensions of Emacs use for functions
                  specific to their particular modes.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>

              <li>Modes: Emacs has major and minor modes. No, music
              lovers, this has nothing to do with Ionian and
              mixolidian. Modes are, for lack of a better word,
              behavior parameters. Each time you change mode, you
              make Emacs behave differently. The hotkey
              combinations change their function in subtle ways
              that are in the context of whatever mode you switched
              to. Each extension of Emacs often has one or more
              major and several minor modes that alter its behavior
              according to what that extension helps you
              accomplish.</li>

              <li>Buffers: Buffers are regions Emacs uses to
              separate information. They are not physical and
              should not be confused with windows though they do
              many of the same things you are used to thinking of
              when you think about what a window does. The Emacs
              user's manual has <a href=
              "http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Buffers.html">
              a very good explanation</a> of what they are and I
              suggest you explore them both in this link and using
              the emacs tutorial so as to familiarize yourself with
              the concept. To get a list of buffers similar to a
              "Window list" or "applications list" which is what
              you may be used to in Windows land, type c-x c-b.
              Just arrow up and down and press enter on the one you
              want to switch to.</li>

              <li>Windows: These are physical regions of the screen
              used to display information. For instance, you can
              have the buffer containing the document you are
              editing split into two windows with one showing where
              you are typing and the other one showing another part
              of the same document. The Emacs Manual has <a href=
              "http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Screen.html#Screen">
              an excellent section</a> on how the screen is divided
              in Emacs. It goes into more detail and also explains
              what frames and rectangles are in the Emacs
              context.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Now that these are out of the way, Let's go back to
            talking about help and reading it.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div id="outline-container-1_3_2" class="outline-4">
          <h4 id="sec-1_3_2"><span class=
          "section-number-4">1.3.2</span> Using the menu bar to
          access help</h4>

          <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1_3_2">
            <p>This is as good a time as any to formally introduce
            the menu bar. Emacs has one that will be easy for
            Gnome, Windows or Mac users to navigate without any
            problem. Hold down the alt or meta key as Emacs calls
            it and press your grave button which on the U.S.
            keyboard, is located to the left of the number 1. Some
            folks call it the back tick. If this doesn't work with
            your particular keyboard, try hitting f10. The menus
            are file, edit, options, buffers, tools and help. To go
            from one to the other, use your up and down arrows. To
            select one, press enter and arrow up and down through
            its options. When you find the one you want, press
            enter. If you make a mistake and want to start over,
            press c-g or control g which is the Emacs quit command.
            It is very similar to what you are used to but with a
            slight variation in the actual menus themselves since
            you don't use right and left arrow. Sometimes there are
            more menu items than this when you are in certain
            pluggins or modes, as they are called but these which I
            listed here are always present. You will see this for
            yourself when we explore some of the modes we'll be
            covering in this tutorial. The help menu is the one you
            want for this section so press enter on it when you
            hear it.</p>

            <p>The items in the help menu are as follows:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Emacs tutorial</li>

              <li>Emacs tutorial change language</li>

              <li>Textual links about copying, redistributing and
              such.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The ones to look at first are the "Emacs tutorial",
            "read the manual" and "key describer". Each of these
            has a hotkey bound to it. I suggest you learn these as
            you will probably be using the help system a lot at
            first. In truth, you will never stop using the help
            system since Emacs has so many features and so much
            functionality that you will discover new stuff all the
            time for which you'll need to read the help files. To
            get back to your work, just open up the buffer list
            with c-x c-b and arrow up and down till you get to the
            buffer containing what you were doing and press enter.
            If you want to get rid of the help buffer you were
            reading, kill it by typing c-x k and pressing
            enter.</p>

          <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1_3_3">
            <p>If you find the menu bar cumbersome, and, believe me
            you will eventually, here are the hotkeys for accessing
            help from Emacs. Note that they all have the c-h
            prefix:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>c-h i: Read the Emacs manual using info. Info is
              the system Emacs uses for its documentation. It
              resembles webpages complete with nodes and
              hyperlinks. You type enter on a link to follow it, n
              for next node (chapter), p for the previous one, and
              space bar to move forward a page inside the node you
              are reading. You can also access the info system by
              pressing m-x and then typing info after which, you
              press return.</li>

              <li>c-h t: Emacs Tutorial. This is a must for anyone
              learning Emacs. In fact, I'm going to recommend that
              you follow it at first opportunity since it is very
              well done and will show you how to move around in a
              file. If you are going to do this, however, skip down
              to the section describing what to expect during your
              first launch of Emacspeak since its unique interface

              the first time they pull it up.</li>

              <li>c-h cap M: This lets you get to a help file that
              has a list of all the hotkeys for a given mode.
              Useful for when you get tired of the menu bar. The
              nice thing about this feature is that each hotkey's
              function is presented as a hyperlink for you to press
              and read more about it if you choose.</li>

              <li>c-h b: More or less the same as c-h cap M but
              much more concise for when you just want a quick
              reference.</li>

              <li>c-h k: Key describer. Just type this hotkey
              combination and then, at the prompt key in a hotkey
              you want described and it will tell you all about
              it.</li>

              <li>c-h a: Appropose. Fancy name for "I want to do x,
              y and z but I have no idea what to push to do it.
              Give me a list of possibles."</li>

        What is Emacspeak and where to find the user's manual.</h3>

        <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1_4">
          <p>Emacspeak is an extension of Emacs written by Dr. T.
          V. Raman, a blind computer scientist currently working
          for Google. It turns it into a self-voicing solution that
          renders it's output in spoken form in a way that makes it
          easier for interacting with it without vision. It added a
          lot of commands and changed the behavior of Emacs while
          doing it so seamlessly that, you don't realize that you
          are using emacspeak features which are not present in an
          unmodified Emacs. It is integrated into Emacs itself to
          such an extent that people who use it tend to blur the
          line between the extension and the application. While you
          are learning however, it is important for you to keep the
          two apart. If you learn your way around Emacs you will
          pick up things on Emacspeak little by little. Once you
          have the basics of Emacs down and can move around in and
          edit files, manipulate the contents of a directory and do
          a few other things, you can focus completely on Emacspeak
          and unlocking its more complex and delightful secrets.
          This learning strategy has worked out rather well for me
          and it is the path I suggest for someone who is
          completely new to Linux and has a strong background in
          Windows and the screen reader solutions there. The reason
          for this is that both will require you to learn some new
          concepts that are tied to how the application and the
          extension work under the hood. This is very important
          since customizing often involves tinkering with some of
          the stuff under the hood which can be a bit foreign to
          the windows user. The truth is, Windows has spoiled us by
          making so much of what goes on under the hood hidden from
          us and automated. A powerful tool like Emacspeak can be a
          bit daunting at times for someone used to all the
          pampering of the Windows environment where the software
          developers and distributors take it upon themselves to
          think for you and lock you away from the code. Sometimes,
          the help files themselves are a bit hard to follow
          without first learning this under-the-hood knowledge so,
          learning a few things about Emacs will help you more
          easily learn how Emacspeak does what it does for you.</p>

          <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1_4_1">
            <p>Emacspeak also has a user's manual which can be
            accessed using the hot key combination c-h c-e. Again,
            that's control h and control e. I will gradually stop
            explaining this as the tutorial progresses so, make
            sure you learn what is meant by this naming convention.
            The Emacspeak user's manual contains many useful and
            practical tips for getting the most out of it so, make
            sure you read it. It is not set up like the info pages
            so, this is a great time to really learn how to move
            around in a file in Emacspeak. While browsing this
            file, you will notice that some things are spoken in a
            lower voice. This is how Emacspeak tells you that you
            are on a link. You can press enter on any one of these
            links and get more information on them. At the end of
            each, there is a "back" link which, when you press
            enter on it, will take you back to the Emacspeak help
            page. There is an online version of the manual you
            might enjoy browsing. Here is its link:</p>

            <p>Another resource for you is the Emacspeak FAQ. The
            FAQ can be found by typing c-e cap F. Note that this is
            a capital f.</p>

          <p>Ok, now that the help system has been introduced, it's
          time to learn how to move around a large bunch of text.
          This is where we learn some more hotkeys. Refer to this
          section frequently in your adventures with Emacs since
          these keys are valid from virtually any environment in
          Emacs. You need to learn these because it is as important
          to know them as it was for you to learn all the key
          combinations Jaws, Window Eyes, or NVDA and their friends
          had you learn in windows to move around. If you just
          stick to the arrow keys, (which, of course, you can),
          you'll be at it for years and years and wind up giving
          up. so, here we go:</p>

            <p>Daunting? Well, at first glance they can be but,
            here's a mnemonic device for you:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>previous, next; back and forth: Previous and next
              line, back and forward word and char.</li>

              <li>The c-hick is smaller than its m-other: Meta
              makes analogous control key combinations do bigger
              things. m-f moves forward a word where as little c-f
              moves forward a character. Get it?</li>

              <li>A beginning is usually to the left of the end:
              c-a is the beginning of the line and c-e is the end
              of it. (Note, Emacspeak uses c-e as a prefix, so you
              have to hit it twice to make it work right.)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>And, c-v and m-v are kind of to be learned on your
            own. It's not because of any special reason other than
            that I haven't been able to come up with anything
            clever by which to remember them. If you can, please
            let us know and we'll stick it in here. v stands for
            vertical is about as far as I've gotten.</p>

            <p>Commands for moving through and reading files are
            not the only commands you will need in Emacspeak. Here
            are a few other useful commands for you. Remember, if
            you don't feel up to memorizing them yet, you do have a
            nice menu bar to fall back on if you need it which you
            can reach through alt plus grave or f10. Here we
            go:</p>

            <dl>
              <dt>Open a file: c-x c-f</dt>

              <dd>This command will put your cursor after the ~/
              which starts all file and directory names inside your
              home folder. If you want to create a new file, simply
              type in its name and press enter. If you want to
              "visit" a pre-existing file, either type its name or
              arrow down through the list of files and directories
              in your home directory and press enter on it when you
              hear its name spoken.</dd>

              <dt>Save your current file: c-x c-s</dt>

              <dd>Works very much like a control s in Windows or
              Gnome. If you have auditory icons turned on, there's
              a neat little bleep unique to this key binding's
              function.</dd>

              <dt>Save as: c-x c-w</dt>

              <dd>The w stands for "write" a file.</dd>

              <dt>Buffer list: c-x c-b</dt>

              <dd>This is very handy. It will give you a list of
              all the buffers you have opened during the current
              session. Use it like you would a task bar or window
              list. Arrow through the different choices and press
              enter to change the focus to the one you want. An
              example of when this is useful is when you are
              browsing a help file and then want to get back to
              where you were. The buffer list will get you there. A
              slightly different way to accomplish this is through
              c-x b as well.</dd>

              <dt>Kill buffer: c-x k</dt>

              <dd>This has a clumsy equivalent in alt f4 in Gnome
              and Windows environments. You kill the buffer you are
              on and it no longer becomes accessible to you for
              anything.</dd>

              <dt>Search forward and backwards: c-s and c-r
              respectively</dt>

              <dd>Highly useful commands. These will let you type
              in a string and actually start jumping you to the
              place you want as you are typing. Press an arrow key
              when you think you are at your destination and read
              the line with c-e l to confirm. I love these commands
              because they help with rapid navigation in a file or
              buffer and work absolutely everywhere including
              shells and directories.</dd>

              <dt>Move to other window: c-x o</dt>

              <dd>Some modes will split your screen into several
              regions called windows and display either part of
              your current buffer or other buffers in those windows
              simultaneously. The Emacs Code Browser is a good
              example of a mode that does this. The c-x o command
              helps you move your cursor to these different
              windows.</dd>

              <dt>One window only: c-x 1</dt>

              <dd>if something has split your screen into more than
              one window as described in the previous command, the
              c-x 1 will get rid of those other windows and only
              have one appear on the screen. The data those other
              windows held is still there, it's just not
              displayed.</dd>

              <dt>emacs command: m-x</dt>

              <dd>Everything bound to a hotkey is actually a
              function or program which you can invoke directly by
              name. For instance, c-h i pulls up the help system of
              Emacs. To invoke it directly, type m-x and, at the
              prompt, type info. You can launch lots of modes or
              applications from the m-x prompt. It's even
              browsable. Have a look with your up and down arrows.
              When you get tired of it, use the following command I
              will show you.</dd>

              <dt>quit: c-g</dt>

              <dd>This command works about like the cancel buttons
              you find in Gnome and Windows. It aborts just about
              anything.</dd>

              <dt>Exit Emacs: c-x c-c</dt>

              <dd>This is very important! It does what you would
              expect. Before Emacspeak goes away, it will ask you
              if you want to save the file you have been working on
              if applicable and it will always ask you if you want
              to kil the "active processes" that exist. You will
              need to actually type out yes on that one not just
              y.</dd>

      Configuration</h2>

      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
        <p>Configuring Emacs and Emacspeak involves several things.
        You may want to add more extensions, change how it talks,
        and change how it behaves in certain situations. You might
        also want to change how it loads when you launch Emacspeak.
        We will discuss all of these next.</p>

        Setting up your environment</h3>

        <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2_1">
          <p>This section talks about how to set up how Emacspeak
          speaks to you and how to make it present information for
          you in certain ways. Before you can customize it though,
          you need to edit the shell script that launches Emacspeak
          found in /usr/bin/emacspeak. To do this, type the
          following at a terminal:</p>
          <pre class="example">
sudo gedit /usr/bin/emacspeak
</pre>

          <p>Once that's done, arrow down till you get to the part
          that begins to talk about exporting to unary mode. You
          need to get rid of those lines. Do this either by
          commenting them out with a # sine or by just deleting
          them altogether. Unary mode isn't necessary for Emacspeak
          anymore and it will slow your system down some. Next,
          find the line that begins with execute emacs -q -l
          followed by a path to the emacspeak file in the
          /usr/share/emacs directory. You need to get rid of the -q
          flag since this will prevent you from being able to
          customize your Emacs at all. If you want to play it safe,
          comment the line out then select, copy and paste a copy
          of it underneath and just delete the -q from that one.
          When you are done, save your changes and you are ready to
          customize.</p>

            more or less preconfigured for use without a setting
            turned on that totally drives you crazy. Even still,
            you will want to learn to customize it. Honestly, the
            fastest way you will find to customize Emacspeak is to
            edit your .emacs file (it's like an ini and a config
            file rolled into one for Emacs), and put your settings
            there. This, however, will involve learning some Emacs
            Lisp, the language Emacs is partly written in, and can
            be a bit heavy going for a new user. Fortunately, an
            alternative method exists.</p>

        Customizing Emacs using Easy Customizations</h3>

        <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2_2">
          <p>As I mentioned previously, the fastest way to
          customize your Emacspeak installation is by editing your
          .emacs file and setting all sorts of variables and
          instructions there. This requires that you either find a
          code snippet to paste into it and hope that the person
          who claims that it works is correct or learning Emacs
          LIsp yourself. A much easier, if time consuming
          alternative is to use the Easy Customizations section of
          Emacs to do this. You get there by typeing m-x customize
          or by hitting c-e cap b from anywhere within Emacs. c-e
          cap c takes you directly to the Emacspeak section of the
          truly massive customizations area. It's hard to explain
          how this thing works. You get a page with links on it
          representing "groups". Pressing enter on these groups
          takes you deeper into the section in question. You then
          arrow around to find the settings you want to save and do
          it either by hitting space bar in certain areas, setting
          things to t (on) or nil (off) in certain places or, in
          still others, by typing numbers or letters and things.
          Each group is read in a lower voice by Emacspeak
          indicating that you can press enter on it to interact
          with it. Most of the buffer is read- only except for the
          places which are usually at the end of lines where you
          can add values. You will use c-e c-e (move to end of
          line) a lot in there. Another handy thing to get real
          familiar with quickly is c-s and c-r. c-s is search
          forward and c-r is search backward. Both will start
          moving the cursor as you type until you land where you
          want to be. Hitting your arrow keys makes the search
          entry field go away and lets you interact with Emacs at
          whatever point you told it to take you to. It's the only
          sane way to navigate this area once you know what you are
          looking for. The important thing to search for is "save
          for future sessions". It should be obvious what that
          does. Please be prepared to spend a lot of time
          familiarizing yourself with this part of Emacs. Once you
          get the hang of it, though, it's pretty quick especially
          if you use the search functions described above.</p>

          <p>Here's what to expect when you launch it for the first
          time. To access the Emacspeak-specific section of the
          rather large customizations area, type c-e c- cap c. You
          should find yourself in the customizations buffer. type
          c-n a bit to move down a few lines. Listen carefully to
          the instructions to this part of Emacs as they are pretty
          self-explanatory. Each item in brackets can be interacted
          with either by pressing enter or by typing in the field
          to the right of it. Use your movement commands liberally.
          To change speech, the [tts] group will be the place to
          go. Once you are done with your customizations, go to the
          top of the buffer with m-&lt; and arrow or c-n down to
          the line that contains the option to save for current or
          future sessions and the exit button. Or, you could cut
          right to the chase by typing c-r to search backwards and
          then typing save for future sessions.</p>

          explanation of this feature of Emacs, I urge you to visit

            left and right to move from column to column such as
            package name, installed version, latest version and
            description. When you get to a package you want, mark

        Using Elpa to extend your Emacs</h3>

        <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2_5">
          <p>Elpa is a system Emacs uses for downloading and
          installing extensions. Some are very large and include
          several modes while others are small and may only consist
          of a minor mode. As you become more proficient in Emacs,
          you will be in a better position to pick which packages
          you want for your machine. In order to make Elpa
          available, you will need to paste a bit of lisp code into
          your scratch buffer. Here is the code. Cut and paste this
          into an empty text file for later use in case you ever
          have to reinstall your Emacs:</p>

          <p>(let ((buffer (url-retrieve-synchronously "<a href=
          "http://tromey.com/elpa/package-install.el">http://tromey.com/elpa/package-install.el</a>")))
          (save-excursion (set-buffer buffer) (goto-char
          (point-min)) (re-search-forward "^$" nil 'move)
          (eval-region (point) (point-max)) (kill-buffer
          (current-buffer)))) Ok, here's what you do:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Inside gnome, open up the text file you pasted this
            into with gedit and copy the code into your
            clipboard.</li>

            <li>Get out of gedit and go to a gnome terminal with
            control alt t.</li>

            <li>Kill orca with orca + q.</li>

            <li>Type emacspeak and press enter to bring up
            emacspeak.</li>

            <li>Get to the scratch buffer with c-x c-b and arrow
            keys, pressing enter when you hear it mentioned.</li>

            <li>Press m-&gt; to get to the bottom of the
            buffer.</li>

            <li>Bring up the edit menu by first hitting f10 to
            bring up the menu bar or alt+` whichever you prefer and
            then arrowing down to edit. Press enter here</li>

            <li>First option should be paste. Arrow up and down a
            couple of times because you don't want to confuse it
            with Paste from Kill Menu. Once you have established
            that it's paste, press enter.</li>

            <li>Your elpa code should be there now. Go to the
            bottom of the buffer with m-&gt; an press left arrow
            till you are placed just after the last
            parenthesis.</li>

            <li>Press c-j to evaluate or run the code. You will
            then get a new buffer which is the elpa package list
            come up after a few moments.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>Once you have elpa installed, just arrow up and down
          through the list of packages and type i next to the one
          you want to install. Do that till you have made all your
          choices and then type x to have it download and install
          them. When you are done, type c-x c-c to close Emacs and
          then bring it right back up again either in console or in
          gnome according to your preference and you should have
          the new packages you wanted installed and ready for
          use.</p>

          <p>I am going to recommend that you install three
          packages right off the bat. These are Facebook, twitter
          and w3. Place an i before the name of each of these as
          instructed above and then, after the last selection,
          press x and give Elpa a few moments to install these. The
          first two are self-explanatory. The third package is a
          web browser for Emacs.</p>

        <p>Now that we have our emacspeak all set up the way we
        want it, let's make it do something for us. The following
        sections can be read independently. They have been written
        so as not to build on one another too much. This way, a
        newcomer to Emacspeak can pick what they want to accomplish
        first to get their feet wet. Remember to refer to the
        hotkey list described in prior sections for help navigating
        them. I suggest you try every one of these at some point.
        You will then get a very good idea of the potential
        emacspeak has. Remember to make heavy use of the info pages
        and the key describers discussed in the section on getting
        help. Also, never forget that Google is your friend. Emacs
        runs primarily on Linux and Unix systems. The internet
        began its life on Unix systems for the most part and Linux
        grew up with the Internet in its modern form and is
        available in dozens of flavors each with their own web
        pages and documentation, forums, mailings and so forth.
        What this means to you is that there are tons and tons of
        web resources for Emacs for you to consult. Use them to the
        fullest extent possible.</p>

        First Launch of Emacspeak</h3>

        <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3_1">
          <p>Let's back up a bit and describe what you can expect
          when you launch Emacspeak for the first time. The very
          first time you launch it from your console or terminal,
          you will hear e-speak load up first and then Emacspeak
          will tell you that it is "fully operational" and all its
          "circuits are working perfectly." You will then find
          yourself on a screen that is the Emacs welcome page. Move
          around on it a bit with c-n and c-p. You will hear it
          announce the Emacs Tutorial and link to Browse the Emacs
          Manual very early on. If you want to take this moment to
          explore these resources, by all means do so. You may find
          it very fascinating and enjoyable to explore this new
          application in as safe a manner as this. Whenever you are
          done exploring Emacspeak and just want to quit, type c-x
          c-c. You will get a prompt that says:</p>

          <p>"Active processes exist. Kill anyway?"</p>

          <p>type "yes" all the way out and, of course, without the
          quotation marks I'm using for grammatical effect. You
          will then find yourself back at the command prompt where
          you started.</p>

        Additional notes</h3>

        <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3_2">
          <p>Please note that I always show you how to use
          Emacspeak from a console and not from Gnome. The reason
          for this is that at the time of this writing, Orca and
          Emacspeak don't work well together due to some snafu with
          the gtk+ support Emacs has freezing at-spi somehow. A
          partial work-around is to bring Emacspeak up in xterm
          which Orca currently doesn't read but, it will still make
          Orca take a while before coming back up when you alt tab
          or control alt right arrow out of Emacspeak and into
          something else. The lock-up can be avoided by putting the
          -nw switch in when you bring up Emacspeak but, for some
          reason, the meta key is unassigned in this launch and
          this causes you to have to use escape as a prefix for
          everything you normally hold down the meta key for. I
          personally find it annoying and don't use it this way
          because it isn't very efficient. You may not find it so
          in which case, feel free to pull emacspeak up in xterm.
          To put in the switch I mentioned, bring it up like
          this:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>From inside gnome, press alt f2 to be prompted
            which application you'd like to run.</li>

            <li>At the prompt, type xterm and press enter.</li>

            <li>You won't hear anything other than, perhaps the
            window title and Orca telling you this place is
            inaccessible. Hopefully, you have sound icons turned on
            in gnome so that pressing down arrow gives you a sort
            of tom-tom drum sound telling you that you are at the
            bottom of the terminal window.</li>

            <li>Type emacspeak -nw and press enter.</li>

            <li>Begin using Emacspeak as normal.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>Don't use gnome terminal unless you are turning your
          orca off because they will both talk at once. If you are
          going to do that, kill orca while you run Emacspeak and
          don't bother with the -nw switch. I've used Emacspeak
          this way a couple of times but I like having Orca around
          for x-windows stuff so, I run my Emacspeak in a virtual
          console, tty1 to be exact. I also like to use speakup in
          the pure console environment so, I have tty2 logged in
          and brought up as well with speakup not toggled off in
          it. I typically have a Gnu Screen session going in there
          so I can multitask inside the console but that is another
          topic for another day. Bottom line is, don't ever ever
          let one good tool cheat you out of being able to use
          another. Avoid the silly romanticized emotional loyalties
          people tend to develop for doing things one way and with
          one thing. Watch out for the pernicious tendencies people
          have of turning their noses up at perfectly good software
          just because they don't like the interface, don't believe
          in how the developer deals with his code or other such
          foolishness most end users could care less about. If you
          are using Emacspeak, it is because you are visually
          impaired. This means that your options for what kind of
          software you can use are limited enough as it is. Don't
          hamper yourself further by turning your back on any tool
          you can use to get the job done. We just can't afford
          that kind of thinking. Use the best tool for the job as
          much as time, resources and inclinations allow and leave
          philosophy and idealism to people like Plato and
          politicians. Ok, I'll get off my soap box now.</p>

          <p>Bringing up Emacspeak in the console is nice because
          you can still have speakup running though in the
          background and it can be called upon to read the screen
          in a traditional screen-reader manner with the number
          pad. To keep speakup from talking over emacspeak, simply
          hold down the numpad insert and press numpad enter. To
          make it speak the screen as it changes again, just press
          that key combination a second time and it'll toggle
          speakup back on for you. All right, now, without further
          adieu, let's get started!</p>

      Manipulating text</h2>

      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
        <p>Emacs is the king of editors. Yes, I know that sounds
        really pompous and I suppose it also sounds rather silly
        but, honest, it's true. No other editor can do as much as
        Emacs can in as efficient a manner and with as much room
        for customizations and extensions as this 30 something
        year-old editor. The next few sections will feature step by
        step instructions on creating files which are, at the core,
        just text files but that do many different things. Here we
        go!</p>

        Your first text file</h3>

        <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4_1">
          <p>In This section will show you how to create and edit
          your first plain text file. If you are used to windows,
          then you are probably used to people looking a scance at
          plain text since there are so many word processors and
          other types of solutions for making text look and behave
          a certain way. In Windowsland, you have .rtf's, .doc's,
          .wpd's, .pdf's, and all sorts of other extensions
          denoting all sorts of files which can only be read by one
          sort of program or changed by one sort of program. The
          humble .txt file is seen as unsophisticated. It isn't and
          these programs use plain text too but with tons of markup
          which they hide from you in all sorts of convoluted ways
          that take away your control of the file. In Linux,
          however, plain text is used extensively and markups and
          such are always available for you to see and understand
          due to the prevalence of free software and open source
          thinking. The text file can be put to many uses. We'll
          really see one of these uses when we write our first
          webpage using Emacs's org-mode but, for now, let's just
          make a text file. It will get you used to editing and
          movement commands within Emacs.</p>

          <p>From the command prompt. do the following:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Make a directory from which to work. So type
            this:</li>
          </ol>
          <pre class="example">
mkdir learn-emacspeak

</pre>

          <ol>
            <li>Now, move to it in order to work from there by
            typing:</li>
          </ol>
          <pre class="example">
cd learn-emacspeak

</pre>

          <ol>
            <li>Now, we can begin. Turn Speakup to quiet mode by
            holding down the numpad insert and pressing enter.
            Espeak will say "You turned me off!" It will hang
            around in the background and can be accessed using your
            number key pad but it won't announce changes in the
            screen anymore. If you just want Speakup out of the
            picture, press print-screen and it wil kill it. Press
            print screen again to bring it back to life.</li>

            <li>The moment of truth is upon us! We're going to
            bring Emacspeak up with a text file. You do this by
            typing the following into a command prompt in the
            console: emacspeak firstfile.txt

              <p>Emacspeak will come up and you will be in an empty
              file buffer. Type a few lines. For instance:</p>
              <pre class="example">
Mary had a little lamb
Whose fleece was white as snow.
And everywhere that mary went,
The lamb was sure to go!
</pre>

              <p>Use the movement keys taught to you in prior
              chapters of this tutorial to move around this file.
              Move around by character, word, and sentence. If you
              decided to type many more lines, you can move by
              screenful by scrolling vertical with c-v and m-v.
              Here are a few editing commands for you:</p>
            </li>

            <li>Delete character: c-d</li>

            <li>Delete word: m-d</li>

            <li>Delete or kill line: c-k</li>

            <li>Paste what you just deleted back into another part
            of the document: c-y (y stands for yank)</li>
          </ol>

          <p>Other exercises:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Press m-&lt; and m-&gt; to go to the top and bottom
            of your file.</li>

            <li>Use c-e B to read your entire buffer. it will ask
            you if you want to read the whole thing or read from
            start to point or from point to end. It's pretty self
            explanatory. To use fewer keystrokes, you can use c-e n
            to read from point forward.</li>

            <li>Press c-n a few times to go to a line of your file
            further down and practice reading the prior line with
            c-e up arrow. Read the current line with c-e l. Find
            out the current line number with c-e e-l.</li>

            <li>Explore the menus in plain text mode to find other
            functionality.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>One thing to note is that Emacs has word wrapping set
          to off by default. If you are going to write a lot of
          pros, you'll want to access the options menu and arrow
          down to "Auto fill in text modes" and press enter. Your
          lines will wrap from that point on. Don't get taken in by
          the actual word wrapping features because they just
          wordwrap for visual effect. Emacspeak won't be fooled and
          will treat your text as single line paragraphs.</p>

          <p>When you are done with your file, Press c-x c-s to
          save your changes.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="outline-container-4_1_1" class="outline-4">
          <h4 id="sec-4_1_1"><span class=
          "section-number-4">4.1.1</span> But wait! What about
          spell checking?</h4>

          <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4_1_1">
            <p>Ok, so now that we have finished typing our text
            file and we've saved it, we don't want to just leave it
            like that. There might be typos in there! Or, you might
            have just slipped up and forgot to double a consonant,
            lengthen a vowel or something like that. To remedy this
            situation, Emacs has a spell checking mode you can turn
            to. From anywhere in your file type m-x ispell-buffer.
            Emacspeak will read the sentence or line of any
            mispelled word and use a lower voice to pinpoint the
            misspelled word for you. You are then given a list of
            choices to choose from. It's pretty straightforward. If
            you get stuck, just type a question mark and you will
            get a nice help file spoken telling you what to do.
            Once you are done spellchecking, hit c-x c-s to save
            and you are set.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div id="outline-container-4_1_2" class="outline-4">
          <h4 id="sec-4_1_2"><span class=
          "section-number-4">4.1.2</span> Visiting files</h4>

          <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4_1_2">
            <p>To edit a new file from an already running emacs
            session or to open a file you had edited previously,
            type c-x c-f. YOu will be placed after the ~/ which
            tells Emacs to visit or create a file in your home
            directory. If you are pulling up our little text file
            at some future point, we would type
            learn-emacspeak/firstfile.txt. Of course, there's also
            completion.</p>

            <p>If you don't remember the exact string to type to
            get to a file, type the beginning of it and then tap to
            get emacs to generate a completion list. Then, type
            page up to put you into the completions buffer where
            you canarrow up and down to pick your completion.
            Sometimes, you get more than one file at a time on a
            line so use left and right arrows to get to other files
            on such lines. That's all there is to it! You now know
            enough to get you started writing text files. Use that
            menu bar when you get stuck and then learn those
            hotkeys by browsing the help files as you go along.</p>

        Let's make a webpage!</h3>

        <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4_2">
          <p>I am now going to teach you how to write your own
          homepage using Emacspeak without knowing a single
          solitary lick of css or html code. Your homepage wil be
          accesible, structured and usable with just about any
          browser out there. You'll be able to save it to a thum
          drive and put it onto any machine you use regardless of
          platform and it will work for you no matter what screen
          reader you use. And, my friend, we will do this in just a
          few short minutes. Don't believe me? Watch and learn!</p>

          <p>We are going to use a built-in mode of Emacs called
          org-mode. It is used for all kinds of things like
          planning agendas, scheduling, writing notes and
          authoring. You can take what you write in this mode and
          have it spit it out to a structured ascii text file, an
          html file, a LaTx file a pdf file and, of course, an html
          file which is what we will be doing. Let's get started!
          Note: You can get more information about org-mode and all
          its many uses by browsing the online manual by following
          this link: <a href=
          "http://orgmode.org/manual/index.html">online version of
          the Org-Mode Manual</a>. If you are in Emacs, you can
          also, of course browse this documentation using info.
          From the command prompt. do the following:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>If you haven't already, make a directory from which
            to work. So type this:</li>
          </ol>
          <pre class="example">
mkdir learn-emacspeak
</pre>

          <ol>
            <li>Now, move to it in order to work from there by
            typing:</li>
          </ol>
          <pre class="example">
cd learn-emacspeak
</pre>

          <ol>
            <li>Now, we can begin. Turn Speakup to quiet mode by
            holding down the numpad insert and pressing enter.
            Espeak will say "You turned me off!" It will hang
            around in the background and can be accessed using your
            number key pad but it won't announce changes in the
            screen anymore. If you just want Speakup out of the
            picture, press print-screen and it wil kill it. Press
            print screen again to bring it back to life.</li>

            <li>Type emacspeak myhomepage.org at the command prompt
            and press enter.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>You are in an empty buffer in Emacs running org-mode.
          Before we write a single line of text, let's turn
          autofill mode on by going to the options menu with either
          alt plus grave or f10 and arrowing down to it. Autofill
          should be one of the first things you hear while arrowing
          down. This will word wrap our lines for us. Now, on to
          our homepage!</p>

          <p>Let's first create the structure of our page. We will
          use 3 headings, personal, technical, and other. We can do
          this in three ways.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Using the menu bar: Press f10 or alt+` to bring up
            the menu bar and arrow down to org mode's menu. Press
            enter. From here, arrow down to "new Heading" and press
            enter. Now, type your heading name and press
            enter.</li>

            <li>With a hotkey: Press c-j and then type your heading
            name. When you are done, press enter.</li>

            <li>Markup tags: This is my favorite way as I can do it
            quickly and on the fly. Type an asterisk and then space
            twice. Then, type in your heading name and press
            enter.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Pick a method and create the heading names I assigned
          you above.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="outline-container-4_2_1" class="outline-4">
          <h4 id="sec-4_2_1"><span class=
          "section-number-4">4.2.1</span> Fil in the Sections</h4>

          <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4_2_1">
            <p>Ok, now, we flesh out our page. Using your arrows or
            c-p and c-n, get to the first one called "personal."
            You will notice that it is preceeded by an asterisk.
            Type c-e c-e to get us to the end of the line and press
            enter. Now, type something brief to remind yourself of
            what's in this section. Something like this:</p>

            <p>This section contains my personal information links
            such as my e-mail page, my bank's page and my social
            accounts pages like Linked-in, twitter and
            Facebook.</p>

            <p>Press enter twice and let's get ready to make our
            links.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div id="outline-container-4_2_2" class="outline-4">
          <h4 id="sec-4_2_2"><span class=
          "section-number-4">4.2.2</span> Creating Links</h4>

          <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4_2_2">
            <p>As in the case of headings, there are three ways to
            put links into your homepage with org-mode. Really,
            there's more than this but, we are trying to keep it
            simple so we will restrict ourselves to three.</p>

            <dl>
              <dt>Using the menu bar:</dt>

              <dd>Again, we hit f10 or alt grave and arrow down to
              org's menu and press enter. Then, we arrow down to
              "hyperlink" and press enter again. We are now in a
              submenu. Arrow until you hear "Insert hyperlink" and
              press enter. From here, we have a list of different
              sorts of links to choose from. If you explore a bit,
              you will find http, https, ftp, sendmail and many
              more which are far too many to list here. Arrow down
              to <a href="http://">http://</a> and enter the url of
              the page you are linking to.</dd>
            </dl>

            <p>Example:</p>
            <pre class="example">
www.vinux-project.org

</pre>

            <p>Press enter again and you are at a point where you
            can enter a description. This is where you enter the
            text you want to hehar telling you what that url is to.
            Along the same vein as our example: Vinux home
            page.</p>

            <dl>
              <dt>A hotkey combination:</dt>

              <dd>To add a link using hotkeys, we use the c-c
              prefix and then c-l. So, c-c c-l and we are in the
              list of url types again. Proceed as outlined above at
              this point.</dd>

              <dt>Using the link markup codes:</dt>

              <dd>Again, this is my personal favorite since I don't
              really like to interrupt my typing to mess with menus
              and lists and things. To add a llink this way, we put
              in square brackets. This is a square bracket: [. You
              want two left square brackets one after the other.
              Then we put the url in. Next, we put in a right
              bracket to close the pair containing the url and
              follow it with a left square bracket. Here, we type
              the link's description. When the description is
              finished, we put a right square bracket to close the
              description field and another to close the link
              addition. When you press enter now, you have a link
              in your page! You can test the link by arrowing up to
              it and noting that Emacspeak speaks it in the lower
              voice designated for links. You can also follow the
              link. You can either do that with the menu bar or
              with the c-c c-o hotkey.</dd>
            </dl>

            <p>Here is an example of some links you can put in your
            page's personal section:</p>
            <pre class="example">
[[http://gmail.google.com][Check your Gmail account]]
[[http://www.twitter.com][Browse my Twitter page]]
[[http://www.facebook.com][My Facebook Page]]
[[http://www.sourceforge.net][Check my Source Forge Account]]
</pre>

            <p>We can put the links in a list. It's really easy.
            Just preceed every line of your list with a plus sign
            and two spaces and then your beginning brackets or the
            insertion of the link and the links will be formatted
            into a list for you. Another way to do it is in a
            table. Each cell is separated by pipes or vertical
            bars. This is a pipe: |. For further guidance in
            creating tables in org-mode, consult the org-mode
            documetation online or thorugh the info pages. I like
            lists because they are easy to navigate with Orca and
            Jaws. Suggestions for the personal heading are a link
            to gmail.google.com, twitter.com and to your bank or
            something like that. Mine has my gmail, rfbd, my
            retirement account, and Linked-in since that's the only
            thing even approximating social networking that I
            do.</p>

            <p>To go to each subsequent heading level in the file
            you are writing, type c-c n for next and c-c p for
            previous. Put your cursor at the end of each line with
            c-e c-e and press enter to get into where you can edit.
            You can fold headings where the stuff inside each of
            them is tucked away form view for you so the document
            tree is browsable and you can read the big picture.
            Makes authoring real easy, I can tell you. I'm using
            org-mode to write this tutorial, as it happens. To
            fold, you get to the line containing the heading and
            backtab. To unfold and read the heading's contents,
            press tab. When headings are folded, emacspeak will
            announce them as such in auditory icons with a sort of
            clicking or clapping sound. Try it out. It's pretty
            neat. when you unfold one, emacspeak will tell you that
            you can view the heading's children.</p>
          </div>

        <div id="outline-container-4_2_3" class="outline-4">

          <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4_2_3">
            <p>Now, it's your turn. Using the example above, fill
            in the rest of your personal links, put in some
            technical links like the Vinux homepage, the Emacspeak
            homepage, the Orca page ETC. Then, in your final
            heading, put in some other links of interest to
            you.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

          "section-number-4">4.2.4</span> Exporting to html</h4>

          <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4_2_4">
            <p>So, now we have our homepage all written up and we
            are ready to export it. Again, you can do this with the
            org menu bar which you should know how to get to by now
            or by typing c-c c-e. You will be asked to enter a
            command. This is where you have the choice to export to
            all sorts of other formats. I'll let you explore those
            on your own. For now, just type h for html. YOu will be
            asked for a document title. Mine says, strangely
            enough, Alex's homepage. Title yours as you want and
            then press enter. Now, either open up another tty
            virtual console or alt f7 to go into Gnome and get to a
            terminal and navigate to your learn-emacspeak
            directory. Perform an ls command to list the files in
            the directory and you should hear the html file in
            there. To test it, launch your favorite browser and see
            how all the links work nicely.</p>

            <p>Congratulations! You have just written your first
            webpage using Emacspeak. Pretty easy, right? To
            continue your learning experience, have a look at the
            org-mode documentation which you can get to through
            info or the org-mode menu and find out about all the
            other amazing things this litttle gem inside of Emacs
            can do for you.</p>

        Let's write some code!</h3>

        <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4_3">
          <p>No document pretending to explain to someone how to
          use Emacs and Emacspeak would be complete, in my opinion,
          without some instructions on coding. Writing programs is
          one of Emacs' primary function among many of its users.
          It's got a mode for just about every language. For our
          purposes, we will use the c-mode which is the one for c
          and c++ and other languages related to it. Don't worry if
          your language is different, all of the concepts I wil
          explore in this brief tutorial are common to all
          programming languages. I just happen to know c++ so, it's
          what I used. If you know Python, Perl, Shell Script, Java
          or something like that Emacs has you covered. Just
          replace the .cpp extension with the one corresponding to
          your language and chances are, Emacs will have a mode for
          it pre-installed and come up for you in that mode. Here
          we go:</p>

          <p>If you write code, I'm going to assume you know how to
          use a command line. If you don't and you want to code in
          Linux, learn it as soon as you can. This section has the
          least amount of hand holding since, if you program, you
          need to be willing to explore more than your average
          user.</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Make a directory called learn-emacspeak in your
            home directory.</li>

            <li>Navigate to that directory from inside a
            console.</li>

            <li>Toggle speakup off with numpad enter.</li>

            <li>Launch emacspeak with the command emacspeak
            program1.cpp.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>You are now inside an empty buffer in Emacs's c-mode.
          Emacspeak will act rather differently here than in other
          environments. Let's write a short program to demonstrate.
          We wil have some comments, some include or, what you
          might know as import statements, a fiew variables and a
          function. Notice how emacspeak's voice changes according
          to context. Write these lines exactly as shown here:</p>
          <pre class="example">
//  This is a comment in c++
// It should be spoken in a monotone voice.
// You can't miss it.
// notice how it treats header file inclusions next
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
// Here's our function
int main ()
{
// Now, an object of type string and its initialization
std::string howdy = "Howdy, partner.  This is emacspeak talking to you!";
int a, b, c;  // Some variable declarations.
a = 1, b = 2, c = 3;  // Assigning them values
std::cout &lt;&lt; howdy &lt;&lt; "\n Let's count to three: \n" 
&lt;&lt; a &lt;&lt; b &lt;&lt; c;
// Print some text using console out in c++.
return 0;  //  We end our program.
}
</pre>

          <p>To save our work, we type c-x c-s. Now, explore the
          file using c-p and c-n and then go by words with m-f and
          m-b. Some new keys that are specific to this mode are m-p
          and m-n which move you to the previous and next statement
          respectively. Make some changes to the comments. Use c-d
          for character deletion, m-d for word deletion and c-k for
          deleting a whole line. c-y "yanks" the line back from
          being killed. It's Emacs talk for paste.</p>

          <p>Have a look at the c-mode menus that are added to the
          menu bar by hitting f10 or alt + grave. When you do the
          next exercise, notice how they are different in the mode
          for your own language. The cc-mode has a lot of other
          functionality but it is something best explored on your
          own since it is only of interest to you if you code in
          c++ and explanations of how that is done are way beyond
          the scope of this tutorial. Another thing to look at is
          the list of hotkeys specific to it by typing c-h m and
          then moving to the help buffer with c-x o. Incidentally,
          c-h b will give you a more compact list of hotkeys.</p>

        favorite newsgroups, it can all be done from within Emacs
        and Emacspeak has been written with support for this

        How about a chat?</h3>

        <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5_1">
          <p>Chatting with Emacspeak is truly a breeze. You won't
          believe how easy it is. The best way to illustrate that
          is to show you how you would chat on the Vinux irc
          channel. Here's what you do:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Launch Emacspeak from the command prompt with
            speakup toggled off by pressing insert + numpad
            enter.</li>

            <li>Once it's up, press m-x and then type erc and press
            enter. Note the spelling, please, it's not a typo.</li>

            <li>Answer the prompts such as the irc server, the port
            (best left as default) and then the nickname you want
            to log in complete with any applicable password. Press
            enter after each entry. This will get you onto the irc
            server from which you can then join a channel of your
            choosing.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>Example:</p>

          <table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules=
          "groups" frame="hsides">
            <colgroup>
              <col class="left" />
              <col class="left" />
            </colgroup>

            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td class="left">Irc Server</td>

                <td class="left">irc.blufudge.net</td>
              </tr>

              <tr>
                <td class="left">port</td>

                <td class="left">6667</td>
              </tr>

              <tr>
                <td class="left">Username</td>

                <td class="left">AlexM</td>
              </tr>

              <tr>
                <td class="left">Password</td>

                <td class="left">Gobbldy-gook</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>

          <p>Give it a few moments and it should tell you that you
          are on the server you chose. At this point, things get
          pretty straightforward because now, you can use the menu
          bar which can be reached with f10 or alt grave accent and
          arrow to the erc-mode menu and press enter. Choose an
          option such as joining a channel and then type in the
          channel you want to join. Another way to do this is to
          just type /join #channelName as you would in any other
          irc client. All the usual irc commands work here. the
          menu bar contains a few helpful shortcuts for when you
          don't know them but you can get away without ever
          visiting it.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="outline-container-5_1_1" class="outline-4">
          <h4 id="sec-5_1_1"><span class=
          "section-number-4">5.1.1</span> Actual chatting tips</h4>

          <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5_1_1">
            <p>Once you have joined a channel, you will want to
            monitor it so you know what people are saying. To do
            this, type c-c c-m. This will monitor your current
            channel. If you have auditory icons turned on, you will
            get a little sound preceeding every message someone
            types. To talk to someone, just type what you want to
            say and press enter. You'll hear a little ding if you
            have auditory icons but not the text you typed. To get
            past this, I usually turn on line echo locally with c-e
            d l.</p>

            <p>You can have multiple channels at a time which you
            are monitoring. Personally, I have no idea why someone
            would want to do this but, I'm sure there are reasons
            out there for wanting to do this. If you have such a
            reason, each channel is in its own buffer. All you have
            to do to switch back and forth between channels you are
            on is to go to the buffer containing that channel and
            its conversations by hitting c-x c-b for the buffer
            list, arrowing down to the buffer in question and
            hitting enter on it. Once you are done chatting, just
            use /leave to leave the channel you are on or go to the
            menu bar and find the leave command in the erc-mode
            menu. Once you've done this, you can either disconnect
            from the server or just kill the buffer you are on to
            stop your erc session. And that's all there is to
            it!</p>

        Let's browse the web.</h3>

        <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5_2">
          <p>In the words of Emacspeak's author DR. T. V. Raman,
          "There are many solutions for browsing the web in
          Emacspeak neither of them entirely satisfactory." For
          most simple html and css pages, you can definitely have a
          very pleasing browsing experience with Emacs w3, the
          closest thing Emacs has to a a native browser. W3 doesn't
          have a Javascript interpreter so, anything containing
          javascript wil have to be accessed through other
          solutions. I will leave it up to you to explore these as
          this is merely a tutorial for getting your feet wet. W3
          is a nice little browser which should fulfill a large
          percentage of your browsing needs. When it comes to more
          complex ones, however, you will really want to use
          another tool like Firefox through Orca. Since Orca
          currently has some slowness issues with regard to
          browsing, though it is good to know that, at least, for
          some of your browsing, you can indeed turn to Emacspeak
          and quickly go through web content. Here's how to get
          started doing this. The plugin you will need is an
          emacs-native browser called Emacs w3. It's not shipped
          with Emacs and its development has stagnated in recent
          years but it's still a nice browser as long as you aren't
          trying to nview web pages with lots of javascript. It's
          even got support for aural css which is a rather neat
          feature. I'll et you Google what this is since
          discussions on it can get lengthy. Anyway, Emacs w3 can
          be put on through Elpa. Refer to the section in this
          tutorial that discusses how to set it up and how to
          install packages using this tool. For the rest of this
          section, I'm going to assume that you followed these
          instructions and have Emacs w3 installed. Another thing
          you may wish to consider is making it so that all html
          documents which are rendered and pulled up as webpages
          instead of source code get pulled up in w3 and not
          something else like Firefox. This can be done in the
          customizations area. Type c-h cap B then arrow up to the
          appropriate subsection and navigate to where this can be
          done. The setting you want to change is labeled "browse
          url."</p>

          <p>To bring it up, simply press m-x and then type w3. It
          should bring up a homepage for itself on the gnu.org
          site. To move around the web, here are the basic
          commands. Note the capitalization of these commands:</p>

          <dl>
            <dt>Moving forward and backward through the available
            links on a page</dt>

            <dd>tab and alt tab respectively</dd>

            <dt>Selecting a link</dt>

            <dd>Enter or return as it's called hereabouts</dd>

            <dt>Open a url</dt>

            <dd>c-o (this one should be no sweat)</dd>

            <dt>top and bottom of document</dt>

            <dd>&lt; and &gt; respectively</dd>

            <dt>Scroll down a page</dt>

            <dd>space bar</dd>

            <dt>Scroll up a page</dt>

            <dd>del key</dd>

            <dt>Reload page</dt>

            <dd>r</dd>

            <dt>Back to your previous page</dt>

            <dd>cap B</dd>

            <dt>Forward to the next page</dt>

            <dd>cap F.</dd>

            <dt>View html source of the page you are on</dt>

            <dd>s</dd>

            <dt>quit</dt>

            <dd>q</dd>
          </dl>

          <p>These commands should get you started. If you want
          more, remember, you always have c-h m to consult. It will
          bring up a list of all the hotkeys for you. There are
          many many more than the ones I mentioned. Also, please
          note that w3 has it's own menu bar. You should find it
          pretty easy to follow since it's very similar to other
          browsers' menu bars.</p>

          <p>While you browse, Emacspeak will announce links in a
          lower pitch voice and will also modulate its voice
          depending on headings, quotes and other attributes of the
          document you are browsing. But, you may ask, are there no
          specific Emacspeak commands? There are many and I will
          let you explore them as you get used to Emacs itself.
          But, there is one priceless gem you will find quite
          useful which I will discuss in the next subsection.</p>

        <div id="outline-container-5_2_1" class="outline-4">
          <h4 id="sec-5_2_1"><span class=
          "section-number-4">5.2.1</span> Url Templates</h4>

          <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5_2_1">
            <p>One of Emacspeak's greatest strengths is how it
            presents you with information and how it allows you to
            interact with Emacs. It's not a screen reader in the
            strictest sense of the word because, it doesn't tell
            you what's on the screen but, rather, what you need to
            know to get the job done. All you have to do to prove
            this point is navigate with your numberpad if you have
            speakup set to off with numpad Enter. You will actually
            hear the physical layout of the screen whereas
            Emacspeak lets you have what you need when you need it.
            An outstanding example of this is the nice variety of
            Url Templates available. These are nice shortcuts to
            parts of long web pages that let you just get right
            down to business and not have to explore a page for a
            long time before arriving at where you want to go.
            Let's explore a couple of these.</p>

            <p>Weather forecast</p>

            <ol>
              <li>From anywhere within Emacspeak, press c-e u. This
              puts you at the top of a long list of templates.</li>

              <li>Arrow down till you hear "Weather Underground."
              Press enter.</li>

              <li>You are right at the edit field where you type in
              your city and state or country of residence to get a
              weather report. Go ahead and type it in and press
              enter. If you are in the U.S. you can also just type
              in your zip code.</li>

              <li>Explore your weather forecast with the commands
              shown above.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Bookshare search:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Again, we type c-e u to bring up our url template
              list.</li>

              <li>Arrow down to the bookshare search entry and
              press enter.</li>

              <li>At the prompt, type in your search query and
              press enter.</li>

              <li>Use the w3 commands to navigate the resulting
              page. When you are finished, press q to quit and you
              will be back where you left off before your browsing
              began.</li>
            </ol>
          </div>

          <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5_2_2">
            <ol>
              <li>There is a lot more to w3 and Emacspeak than what
              I covered here. Take a few moments and explore it
              thoroughly using the info pages, and by googling for
              more information online. Conveniently, there's a
              google search URL. Try putting it to use in this way
              and use your newfound knowledge to browse the
              resultant page.</li>

              <li>Checking your gmail account. Use the url template
              for gmail which has been provided to check your
              e-mail in gmail through a browser session. Write a
              few e-mails yourself. This will teach you some new
              commands and show you how to interact with forms. If
              you get stuck, remember c-h b and c-h cap m contain
              key bindings which might get you out of a pinch.</li>

        Sending e-mail</h3>

        <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5_3">
          <p>If you have a setup on your linux box that enables you
          to send and receive mail system wide, Emacs can also be
          used as a mail client. If you don't have this set up yet,
          I will warn you that it is a pretty technical and
          advanced thing to do and will consume some time if you
          have never done it before. You will need to acquire and
          configure Fetchmail, Procmail and either Postfix or
          Sendmail. These are programs that handle different
          aspects of sending and receiving e-mail at a system
          level. Emacs then pulls the incoming messages from your
          system mail box usually located in /var/mail/username
          whereX user name is your login name on your machine.
          Outgoing mail gets sent out through whatever you are
          using as an outgoing mail handling program such as
          Sendmail or Postfix. There is a lot of information out
          there on the net on how to set this stuff up on your
          machine. I suggest you have a good look at it before
          attempting this.</p>

          <p>Assuming you got it set up, here's how you send and
          receive e-mail with Emacs. We will use the basic
          mail-mode. There are two other more complex ones that
          ship with Emacs called Gnus and mh-e which can be used
          for this purpose which you are encouraged to investigate.
          There are others which can be gotten through synaptic or
          by visiting webpages containing them on the net and
          installing them directly by hand. Dr. Raman states in the
          user manual for Emacspeak that he is partial to VM.</p>

          <p>First, reading your e-mail is as easy as typing m-x
          rmail. The interface is a bit old fashioned so you will
          get a ton of header file information that most other
          clients just hide from you. Use c-n to get past all of
          that stuff and you will get to the body of your message.
          You can use either c-e B (note the capital b), to tell
          Emacspeak to read the whole buffer from point to you or
          you can read the mesage by screenful with c-v. m-n will
          take you to the next messsage once you are done reading
          it. As usual, there's also a menu bar that contains many
          more features and c-h b or c-h m will give you more
          hotkeys if you don't want to fool with the menu bar. To
          exit the mail mode, hit q for quit.</p>

          <p>Sending e-mail is done by typing c-x m. You are at a"
          to:" prompt. Just type the e-mail address of your
          recipieent and hit down arrow to get to subject. Type in
          the subject and arrow down twice because there's a line
          of dashes you have to get past. Type your message and
          then c-c c-c to send it out and exit mail. Again, you are
          encouraged to explore the other features by using the
          menu bar and the hotkey lists.</p>

      Retreat into your shell, why don't you?</h2>

      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
        <p>Emacspeak grants you access to a shell from within Emacs
        by making it fully speech enabled. All you do is type m-x
        and then, at the prompt, you type the word shell and press
        enter. You will then hear a command line prompt which you
        can treat like you would any other. All of the cursor
        movement keys are operational. Also, all of the emacspeak
        reading commands are operational so you can interact with
        other parts of the screen without moving your cursor. This
        means, that you can usually scroll up quite a few lines to
        read output. This shell is extremely handy when performing
        system administration if something you did caused you to
        lose speech in Speakup or Orca or Yasr. Emacspeak then
        becomes a very nice safety net. Who knows? YOu may even
        find that you prefer accessing your shell from Emacspeak as
        opposed to speakup or from a terminal within Gnome. It is
        definitely convenient.</p>

        <p>The shell also lets you launch programs like Alpine,
        Abook and Lynx just as you would in a console session.
        Emacspeak then acts like a regular screen reader with these
        solutions.</p>

        <p>An immediate use to which you can put the shell in the
        context of this tutorial is by compiling the code we wrote
        earlier in the "Let's write some code" section. Here's what
        you do:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>From anywhere in emacs, type m-x.</li>

          <li>At the prompt, type shell and press enter.</li>

          <li>Now, we type g++ program1.cpp -o program1 and press
          enter.</li>

          <li>All the compiler messages you may be used to seeing
          will come right up for you . Or, if all is well, it
          compiles without a hitch. It shouldcompile but, if it
          doesn't for some reason, you will have to go in and fix
          the code. I'm assuming you know some c++ so you can do
          that. There are tons of people way more qualified than me
          to teach you c++.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The whole thing can be done right from inside Emacspeak.
        Pretty convenient, right?</p>

      <h2 id="sec-7"><span class="section-number-2">7</span> File
      Management</h2>

      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">
        <p>Emacs has a very nice file management mode called dired
        Mode. It's very powerful and fully enabled with all the
        Emacspeak functionality. To access it, type either c-x d or
        m-x dired. You will be placed in a buffer which contains a
        list of the files in your current directory. From here, you
        can delete, rename, change ownership, and much much more.
        It's a bonified file management system which rivals all the
        others you have probably used. Also, it keeps its interface
        whether you are working on your own machine's files or even
        an ftp directory.</p>

        <p>to navigate in this area, use your arrow keys to go up
        and down and listen to the file names in the directory you
        are in. To go to another directory, go to the top of the
        buffer and arrow down a few lines until you get to the line
        containing your current directory location. Hit c-e twice
        to get you to the end of the line and either append the
        subdirectory you want to go to or backspace until you have
        a blank line in which to type the name of the directory you
        want to go to. If you don't remember the full name, don't
        worry. Emacs has awesome completion features. Just hit page
        up and you will be taken to completions buffer where you
        can arrow to and press enter on the item you want. Asside
        from the global hotkeys discussed in the introductory
        material, there are many more unique to this mode which you
        can find by typing c-h b. Then, c-x o to get to the other
        window and read the help file listing them all. If you
        don't feel up to hotkeys, there is, of course, a nice set
        of menus from which you can choose by hitting alt
        grave.</p>

      Playing media files in Emacspeak</h2>

      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-8">
        <p>Note: This section was written by Dave Hunt. Some very
        minor modifications to sentence structure were made to fit
        into this tutorial as a whole but, I've changed as little
        as I could of his original content. Thanks,
        Dave!&Atilde;&cent;&acirc;&sbquo;&not;&acirc;&euro;Alex
        Midence</p>

        <p>First things first, using dired mode to browse and
        listen to music files will not work. In its default setup,
        dired mode will not open external apps, such as mplayer.
        Rather, it will visit the file at '.' in a new buffer,
        applying appropriate editing/display 'modes' to this
        buffer. In the case of an 'mp3' file, it likely opens in
        'fundamental mode'. This is a text editing mode, used in
        the absence of other modes. If you do not have Mplayer
        installed on your machine already, go ahead and install it
        before you set Emacs up to play your media files. Now that
        mplayer is installed, get the emms (Emacs Multimedia
        System) package. You can use elpa for this. Next, put some
        setup code into '~/.emacs', here it is:</p>
        <pre class="example">
;;; mark here... 
;;; Fore emms. 
(require 'emms-setup) 
(emms-all) 
(emms-default-players) 
(setq emms-source-file-default-directory "~/Music/") 
;;; end lisp code 
</pre>

        <p>I cobbled the above together from my reading of the
        '.info' doc for emms, and some use of the 'describe-mode',
        'describe-variable', and 'describe-function' operations.
        Being fueled with a super-duper latte helped, too. While
        writing this, I started emms-browse-by-artist, one of the
        available functions. If your files are tagged, you'll be
        able to browse by artist, album, genre, and year. Maybe
        there are more? Anyway, you'll get a kind of 'tree view',
        in which hitting 'spacebar' expands and collapses branches.
        'shift+return' adds selected track to playlist; 'c-j'
        plays. You can shuffle, sort, edit your playlist.</p>

        <p>Another music option is emacs-m-player, a front-end that
        controls your installed mplayer app. One way to start it is
        to type 'm-x emacspeak-m-player' and hit 'enter'. You'll be
        asked for a resource to play. This should be a playlist, in
        the form of '.m3u' or '.pls'. The default is to play
        tracks, in order. If you want to play a stream, you can
        either save its playlist to a local directory, and use
        emacspeak-m-player, or, you can use one of the emacs web
        clients, and an associatd function for playing the url at
        '.'. Here's an example: I like the station
        'radioparadise.com'. If I use the w3m browser, I can visit
        this main page, go to the 'listen now' area, and select one
        of the links. Typing 'l', when the link is under '.',
        automatically launches emacspeak-m-player and gives it the
        stream's playlist. To do this same thing in the w3 browser,
        I can put '.' on the desired link, and type 'e e'. I'll be
        prompted for the name of the function to pass the url to.
        'emacspeak-m-player' should begin playing the stream. If I
        now go back to the emacspeak-m-player buffer, I have a few
        single-key commands, including '+' and '-' to raise and
        lower volume. There are a bunch of commands for adjusting
        the balance and eq, but I've not used them. I find the
        playing of music within emacs very cumbersome, and usually
        save my listening for when I'm in Gnome, where I use
        rhythmbox.</p>

      Wrapping it up</h2>

      <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-9">
        <p>When I set out to write this little tutorial, it was out
        of a desire to help prospective new users of Emacspeak get
        a taste of its power and potential for enhancing their
        productivity and do so painlessly and as quickly as
        possible. I wanted to do this in such a way that said
        newcomers would actually be able to get a feel for this by
        accomplishing something worthwhile within the first few
        minutes after launching it. I also wanted to do something
        about decreasing the steep learning curve Emacs and, by
        extension Emacspeak has due to the different interface and
        the higher expectation of tweaking from the end user. I
        hope I have succeeded. I hope that you have decided to
        learn more about Emacspeak and that you have been
        encouraged to investigate all its possibilities. It is rare
        that a blind person finds a truly accessible, low cost, and
        reliable piece of software that puts one on an equal
        footting with sighted counterparts in the manner Emacspeak
        does. We can all be grateful that Dr. T. V. Raman was
        generous enough to share his software with all of us the
        way that he did and that he chose to do so free of cost at
        a time when assistive technology seems enamoured with the
        $1000 figure. The man can not be commended enough, in my
        humble opinion. It's no accident that Emacspeak has gotten
        the accolades it has and enjoys the fierce devotion of its
        userbase the way that it does. I'm sure you will agree by
        now that it is an awesome bit of software and a must-have
        in your accessibility toolkit.</p>

        <p>Hopefully, what you did is pick one of the tasks
        introduced above, tried it out and then promptly turned
        around and tried them all out possibly in order but maybe
        not. If you didn't do this, I want you to go back and do
        so. Once you have done this, I want you to do some
        homework. Yes, I'm a teacher by profession , as it turns
        out and giving homework comes as naturally to me as
        breathing. I want you to investigate social networking with
        Emacspeak. I also want you to check out the games which Dr.
        Raman has enabled on here. Tetris, for one, is quite
        interesting as is chess and all the rest. As for the social
        networking stuff, here's a tip, Facebook and Twitter have
        their own modes in Emacs whose individual manuals are just
        a google search away. E-mail has many modes also, some of
        them much more advanced than the one we explored together.
        A few of these are built into Emacs itself and still others
        can be gotten through Synaptic package manager. This, too,
        is just a google search away. I also want you to look into
        other authoring modes like Muse Mode and even Auctext. The
        latter is pretty advanced but, extremely handy to know
        since it lets you create a document and set the type-facing
        on it so that it comes out looking great and you can do
        this without vision just by using markup in the LateX
        language. For those of you with a bent towards coding, give
        Emacs Lisp a shot. There's an info manual right inside of
        Emacs that you can use to help you get started right away.
        Make some code contributions for us all to benefit from. We
        can not expect Dr. Raman to do it all, you know. We must
        all give something back. Lastly, I want you to always be
        willing to help other newcomers to Emacspeak out by aiding
        them in learning this piece of software quickly and become
        productive in it very quickly. In fact, share your new
        discoveries with other users of all levels in places like
        the Emacspeak list and the Vinux Forum. I look forward to
        learning from such postings.</p>

        <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-11_1">
          <p>This tutorial was written for users of the Vinux
          distribution of Linux which, as of version 3.01, comes
          with Emacspeak pre-installed for you. However, if you are
          using another distribution or, you just want to build it
          up yourself, the following supplemental sections wil walk
          you through doing just that.</p>

          <h4 id="sec-11_1_1"><span class=
          "section-number-4">11.1.1</span> Using Synaptic</h4>

          <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-11_1_1">
            <p>This section assumes prior experience using the
            Synaptic package manager system found in Debian-based
            Linux distributions:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>From within synaptic, type control f for search
              and type Emacs and press enter.</li>

              <li>Tab a few times till you get to the package
              column and arrow down through the choices until you
              get to either emacs 23 or emacs gtk.</li>

              <li>Press control i to mark for installation.</li>

              <li>Press control p to apply changes and build Emacs
              before installing emacspeak.</li>

              <li>Once Emacs is done installing, type control f for
              find again and type in emacspeak.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>6 as before and arrow through the choices you are
            provided. Emacspeak 32 is the one you want.</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Mark and apply changes as instructed above with
              control i and control p.</li>

              <li>Inform Emacspeak at the prompt that you are using
              espeak as a speech synthesizer and none as the port
              and select forward.</li>

              <li>You will need to repeat the port number towards
              the end of installation too.</li>

              <li>Once Emacspeak is done building, just run it from
              the command line using emacspeak.</li>
            </ol>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div id="outline-container-11_1_2" class="outline-4">
          <h4 id="sec-11_1_2"><span class=
          "section-number-4">11.1.2</span> Using the command
          line</h4>

          <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-11_1_2">
            <p>In Vinux, installing Emacspeak is as easy as:</p>
            <pre class="example">
sudo apt-get install emacspeak
</pre>

            <p>All the dependencies will be built for you. The only
            danger is that it will build with the emacs 23
            Metapackage of Ubuntu and it includes some stuff whose
            behavior I am not sure of and which has produced odd
            effects for me in the past. You may not have these
            problems, however.</p>

            <p>If your distribution is other than Vinux, the
            recommendation is as follows:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Install Emacs on your machine first. This is done
              by either apt-get or through another one of your
              favorite package management solutions in Linux.</li>

              <li>Once Emacs is built, then, use that same package
              manager to build emacspeak on it.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>example:</p>
            <pre class="example">
apt-get install emacs
apt-get install emacspeak
</pre>

            <p>Either way, you will get a menu prompting you to
            choose which speech synthesizer to use. E-speak is my
            recommendation since it is free and reliable and can be
            sped up quite a bit. You will be asked for a server
            port. Answer none to this question and tab to the
            forward button and press enter. YOu may be asked this
            question again. Answer none each time. Eventually,
            everything will build and you will be able to launch
            Emacspeak from the console command prompt.</p>

            <dd>This is the older document mentioned previously.
            There are still many valuable pieces of information in

            You might even write an extension yourself. This link
            takes you to a resource for learning how to do just
